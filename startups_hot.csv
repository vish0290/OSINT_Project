,startups,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

We are building a tool to create automated product catalogs. Here’s how it will work-

You give us a google sheets link to your products which has the product name, image, description, price etc. 

You can either upload a png of your catalog background or we can import your designed template from canva.

We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.

We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.

Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.

You can download your catalog as a pdf

My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.

&lt;p&gt;You give us a google sheets link to your products which has the product name, image, description, price etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either upload a png of your catalog background or we can import your designed template from canva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download your catalog as a pdf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While catalog generation and updation is a bottleneck for them, they want it as a service. Where we create excel, create catalog template and generate catalogs for them. Would anyone be interested in this as a diy tool?&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"
I’m a software engineer based in Australia with startup experience—I ran a small company with 5 employees for 3 years and sold it 10 years ago.

I’ve built an AI app, available only on the App Store, for small businesses like plumbers and electricians. The app helps with:

Invoicing: For example, a plumber can say, “Just fixed John Doe's dishwasher, bill him $200,” and it generates the invoice.

Task management and client tracking

Ad campaigns: Users can ask the AI to set up a Facebook ad to find customers nearby.

Website updates: Easily update pricing or services with voice commands.

The app is live but still in early stages. Some people downloaded it, but no one has registered yet. I also need to add key features like ad campaign tools.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I look for co-founders with skills in online ads (like Google or Facebook Ads) or technical expertise to help grow it?

Or should I focus on finding investors so I can hire a dev team and salespeople?

What’s the smarter choice to grow from here? If co-founders are the answer, how do I find the right ones? If it’s investors, where do I start without a user base?

I’d really appreciate your advice. Thanks!

,startups,"Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains – this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

Here's the latest 36 ideas:

Hope this is useful. If anyone would like to ensure I include any particular podcasts or episodes etc. in future posts, very happy to do so.

I'll generally send \~5 ideas per week in a short weekly digest format (you can see the format I'd usually use in here: podcastmarketwatch.beehiiv.com).

I find it mindblowing that the latest models with large context windows make it even possible to analyze full transcripts at such scale. It's a very exciting time we're living through!

Would love some feedback on this stuff, happy to iterate and improve the analysis/ideas... or create a new newsletter on a different topic if anyone would like.

,startups,"Starting a business is thrilling, but figuring out how to share equity among co-founders and team members can be a bit overwhelming. If you're new to this, here’s a straightforward guide to help you navigate this important process.

What Is Equity, and Why Does It Matter?

Equity is essentially a share of ownership in your company. When divided fairly, it ensures that everyone on the team feels valued and motivated to contribute to the startup’s success. On the flip side, unfair equity splits can cause tension and even harm your business.

Key Things to Think About When Dividing Equity

1. Role and Contribution
Consider what each person brings to the table.

Founders usually get a larger share because they take on the most risk and responsibility.

Early employees may receive smaller shares, but stock options can help these grow over time.



2. Time Commitment
Someone working full-time deserves more equity than someone contributing part-time. Be clear about expectations and reward efforts fairly.


3. Risk and Sacrifices
If someone is leaving a stable, well-paying job or investing personal savings into the business, they’re taking a bigger risk and might deserve a higher stake.


4. Milestones and Vesting
To avoid issues where someone leaves early but keeps their full share, implement a vesting schedule. A common approach is a 4-year vesting plan with a 1-year cliff—this means equity is earned gradually, and no shares are given if someone leaves within the first year.


5. Market Standards
Research what’s typical in your industry. For example:

Founders: Share 50-80% of equity among themselves.

Advisors: 0.5-2%.

Early employees: 0.1-1% each, depending on their role and how early they joined.



6. Planning for the Future
It’s smart to reserve 10-20% of equity for future hires, partnerships, or investors.



Approaches to Dividing Equity

1. Equal Splits
This is the simplest approach but not always the fairest. It works only if everyone contributes equally—which is rare.


2. Dynamic Equity Splits
This model adjusts equity based on actual contributions over time. Tools like the Slicing Pie Model can help track inputs such as time, money, and resources to allocate shares more accurately.


3. Founder Agreements
Talk about expectations early. Draft a clear founder’s agreement that outlines how equity is divided and what happens if someone leaves or doesn’t meet expectations.



Pitfalls to Avoid

Rushing the Process: Take the time to have open and honest conversations with your team. Miscommunication now can lead to bigger problems later.

Skipping Legal Formalities: Always involve a lawyer to ensure your equity agreements are legally sound.

Overpromising: Avoid giving away too much equity early on. Keep some room for growth and future opportunities.


Final Thoughts

Sharing equity isn’t just about dividing numbers—it’s about valuing the people who make your startup possible. Taking a thoughtful approach now can help build trust and set the stage for long-term success.

What’s your experience with sharing equity? Let’s discuss below!",t2_p6i1i00gb,False,,0,False,How to Share Equity in a Startup?,[],r/startups,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1h6cjma,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},I will not promote,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1733306129.0,text,6,,,text,self.startups,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a business is thrilling, but figuring out how to share equity among co-founders and team members can be a bit overwhelming. If you&amp;#39;re new to this, here’s a straightforward guide to help you navigate this important process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Is Equity, and Why Does It Matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity is essentially a share of ownership in your company. When divided fairly, it ensures that everyone on the team feels valued and motivated to contribute to the startup’s success. On the flip side, unfair equity splits can cause tension and even harm your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Things to Think About When Dividing Equity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role and Contribution
Consider what each person brings to the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders usually get a larger share because they take on the most risk and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early employees may receive smaller shares, but stock options can help these grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time Commitment
Someone working full-time deserves more equity than someone contributing part-time. Be clear about expectations and reward efforts fairly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk and Sacrifices
If someone is leaving a stable, well-paying job or investing personal savings into the business, they’re taking a bigger risk and might deserve a higher stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milestones and Vesting
To avoid issues where someone leaves early but keeps their full share, implement a vesting schedule. A common approach is a 4-year vesting plan with a 1-year cliff—this means equity is earned gradually, and no shares are given if someone leaves within the first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market Standards
Research what’s typical in your industry. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders: Share 50-80% of equity among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisors: 0.5-2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early employees: 0.1-1% each, depending on their role and how early they joined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning for the Future
It’s smart to reserve 10-20% of equity for future hires, partnerships, or investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaches to Dividing Equity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equal Splits
This is the simplest approach but not always the fairest. It works only if everyone contributes equally—which is rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,startups,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing €75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

,startups,"We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

# Why Now?

* **Economic Pressure**: Businesses are facing tighter margins and growing pressure to cut costs amidst economic uncertainty.
* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.
* **Demand for Efficiency**: Companies are increasingly seeking tools to streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize ROI.

# Competition

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don’t actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.
* **DIY Research**: Most businesses rely on manual comparisons and reviews, which is time-consuming and prone to missed opportunities.

,startups,"So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

Any wise words from the community? Thank you",t2_ddsz8,False,,0,False,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?",[],r/startups,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1h5y72m,False,light,0.91,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},I will not promote,False,8,,False,False,,1733265962.0,,[],{},,True,,1733260026.0,text,6,,,text,self.startups,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it&amp;#39;s a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it&amp;#39;s not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it&amp;#39;s a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of &amp;quot;wishful thinking&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many &amp;quot;whats&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ifs&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;strong&gt;example&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;#39;s say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors&amp;#39;, and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it&amp;#39;s more or less binary with the compliance (it&amp;#39;s either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it&amp;#39;s what I am aiming for in the future?..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer it&amp;#39;s really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven&amp;#39;t talked to customers first.

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster.

I've often read and seen people using avatars for their marketing strategy. I undestand that bringing your target audience 'into live' is nice to get a better feeling of what they are like and ultimately how to get in touch with them. But from my understanding most of the characteristics is based on pure speculation and assumptions. Let's take my example with the 30 year old male. I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

I am pretty sure I miss something here, in this entire create an avatar concept.

Do you create an avatar for your marketing strategy? If yes, how does it help you exactly?

I’m doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I’ve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners—things like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don’t fit founders’ needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts to help shed light on what really matters to founders when choosing a bank.

If you’re a founder, here are a few quick questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	Who do you currently bank with, and why did you choose them?
	2.	What were the most important factors in choosing your bank (e.g., fast onboarding, reputation, digital tools)?
	3.	What’s one thing you wish your banking partner did better?
	4.	At what stage of growth did having a strong banking relationship become critical for your startup?

Feel free to answer any or all of these! Your insights will go into a write-up I’m working on, and I’m happy to share the findings if you’re interested—just let me know in the comments.

I have a survey that would be super helpful to have filled out and takes about 2 min to complete — if you’re open to it, DM me and I’ll send the link :)

We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

I'm building a lightweight, mobile-first CRM for gig workers (think fitness trainers, hair stylists, wedding singers, stuff like that).

&lt;p&gt;The problem is now I&amp;#39;m close to what could be considered an MVP, but I sort of want to trash it and start over. I feel like with what I&amp;#39;ve picked up from videos and from other apps in the market, I can make a better MVP by starting fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts one way or the other to help me think through this? I&amp;#39;d ideally like to launch, advertise, get some users, then find a tech person to help me build, but I&amp;#39;m wondering if it makes more sense to just throw something functional out into the world or to really make the beset MVP possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: The responses are almost a 50/50 split! Haha. You’ve all given me a lot to think about. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"Hey everyone,

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There’s no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We’re not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here’s the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we’ve put into the company. Right now, he’s unable to pay more money because he’s fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states **""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""** which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I’m a software engineer—I can code fast and efficiently—but this feels like uncharted territory.

I’m currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I’m not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I’m skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes, **stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He’s also offered $500–$1000 a month, but I’d honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here’s my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I am currently a junior in college. I previously, in highschool and at the start of college, ran an Etsy 3D Printing store. I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea. Over the past 3 years, I have had multiple Venture Capital and Incubator internships, working at some pretty large VCs, one having $500M in AUM. I have learned a lot through these internships, specifically on the deal sourcing side and raising side, and I think I would make a really valuable non-technical founder. I also have gained a really strong network of potential capital raisers, and my dad is a lawyer who works with Startups and Venture Capital firms to raise money.

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I’m not sure if it’s something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

**How You Can Help**

,startups,"Hi :) 

  
I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

I'm in the early stages of building an MVP for my startup, and could really use some advice and encouragement from this amazing community.

A bit about my startup: My company is focused on revolutionizing agricultural trade and beyond. Our vision is to empower smallholder farmers by connecting them with global buyers through a blockchain-integrated web portal.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.
It's been a challenge balancing the development costs while maintaining the momentum of the project.

Advice on getting investors after completing the MVP: For those of you who've been here before, how did you approach investors at this stage? What worked for you?

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *“You’re a lifesaver!”* That’s when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I’ve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It’s been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I’ve started working on another extension for Claude, which I’m hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

But one day, I thought &lt;em&gt;“Why not try making my own dream come true?”&lt;/em&gt;. That’s when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding folders to organize chats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving and reusing prompts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinning important chats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files&lt;/li&gt;

After 4 years of working as a software dev at a full-time job, I’m finally taking the leap and starting my own SaaS journey. It feels like a big step—exciting, but also a little intimidating to start something on my own.

SaaS has always fascinated me: the idea of building something scalable that solves real problems for people. I’ve worked on plenty of projects over the years—some super exciting, others just routine bug fixing—but I’ve always loved the process of turning raw ideas into something functional and (hopefully) valuable.

Now, I’m diving into it full-time. My plan is to help others—early-stage founders, solo entrepreneurs, or anyone sitting on a SaaS idea—bring their visions to life. I’ll be sharing what I learn, mistakes I make, and hopefully some wins along the way.

If you’ve ever launched (or even thought about launching) a SaaS product, I’d love to hear ur experiences! What worked? What didn’t? What’s one thing you wish you knew when you started?

And if you’ve got an idea you’ve been sitting on for a while but aren’t sure how to get it off the ground, feel free to DM me. I’m always up for chatting about ideas and brainstorming solutions.

,startups,"Hey founders! 👋

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting** after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.** Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation? How did you figure out if it was time to seek validation in more dynamic markets? I need to connect with those who've been through this.

Navigating the startup world can be overwhelming, especially when resources are scattered and hard to find. As a native Detroiter and lifelong Michigander, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to uncover statewide resources like co-working spaces, funding opportunities, accelerators, grants, and events. If you’re not from a specific region or deeply connected, these opportunities can feel hidden.

So, I decided to create a free, searchable directory of Michigan startup resources. It’s designed for entrepreneurs and founders to quickly filter resources by region and tags, making it easy to find exactly what you need—no endless Googling or outdated lists.

This started as a personal project to help me organize everything, but I realized how much value it could provide to others in the startup ecosystem. My goal is to keep it updated and add even more resources over time.

,startups,"I'm a first year university student working at a student-led nightclub recommendation startup as one of their founding ML engineer (mainly recommendation and backend). The idea is that it would follow instagram-reel format and show videos from events or nightclubs based on user's preferences. Apparently, our main source of revenue will be from skimming off the top from ticket purchases at events or selected nightclubs to cover majority of our operating costs. The crux here, imo, is that it can not scale efficiently nor generate sufficient profit to be viable.

So, right now, I have two options:

* work with the start up for 4 years throughout my undergrad
* jump ship at some point (probably soon because I don't think investment will come soon since similar competitors are better than our product by a long-shot)

,startups,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

No matter how amazing your product is, if users don’t understand it or it takes too long to get started, it’ll quickly become a service no one uses.  

Plus, being too hesitant to show a paywall can hold back revenue, and a trial period that’s too short might stop users from even giving it a chance.

,startups,"I recently looked into Carta's discounts for early-stage tech startups and thought I'd share what I found, in case it's useful to others. If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don’t meet those criteria, you’ll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven’t already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free—Stripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

Hope this info is helpful!

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

As much as I can study I feel that I wont be able to turn that knowledge into a valid product since I'm only studying online and right now there are some startups in the same sector composed by tens of Phds that work to innovate and create new technologies, advancing at an incredible rate. Just the other day I saw a leaked video of a test conducted by a small chinese startup (operating in the exact same field I want to break into) that was fucking mind blowing. 

 I know that everything is possible and if you don't believe in yourself then nobody will, and in fact I'm hungry, I really am, but please give me some advice on how to overcome this doubts (if possible) and how to make things concrete instead on staying forever on a learning phase.

,startups,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

,startups,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on launching an app that connects service providers with users through a subscription model. The idea is to make it easier for people to find and hire reliable professionals for a specific type of service (I can’t share all the details just yet).

Here’s the truth: sales isn’t about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I’ve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50–100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer’s pain points.
4. **Don’t Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return—like a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you’re not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you’re flying blind.

,startups,"Hi everyone.

It's often said, that what matters most is not the things you build **but the person you become.** I have destroyed this person.

I will try to make this as short as possible.

**Story (skip if you want)**  
I'm failing my startup that I have worked on for 3 years now, full time. We made a MVP, got an investment, and over the few years 2 more investments. We were 4 cofounders. As all other startups we had some problems, but generally did a pretty decent job - But the last year things just went down down down.

6 month ago I could see where we were heading, so instead of driving 180 miles/hours off the cliff we acted. I was the person most suited for the job, so all got dismissed except me. I geared things down and ran the startup for 6-8 months alone, hoping to find a solution. It was hard. We were hoping for some light at the end Q4, and even though we reach much higher than previous years, it's not enough - We will die in a few months.

I have already gotten my previous job back that can sufficiently provide for my private financial situation (house, wife, kids) and ALSO give me time to work on another startup if I want to. I can give details if asked. My former coworkers are far ahead of me in this field now, and this is also hard to see, but I knew the risk.

**The problem:**  
The thing is. I WAS an incredible person. My strength as a person was my self discipline. I always did the right and uncomfortable thing. Ate right, worked out, spend every waking hour building, early mornings, and it paid off greatly. I build some incredible things. I peaked very early. Too early.

And the last few years has really taken a toll. Im exhausted. I have learned ALOT in the past few years, and I want to apply them on my new startup but i'm not getting anywhere, because my actions doesn't match my plans/words.

Let me give you one final piece of the puzzle. When I build my persona with incredible self discipline and skills, I read maybe 170 self discipline/help/business books. Now I can't find anything that inspires me, and because I have already read almost everything, i'm not getting excited and pumped by anything. I reread them alot, but they does nothing for me. Even ""No Excuses"" by Brian Tracy, that was my bread and butter is worthless for me.

Last note: I know when I write exhausted, every one will say: Take a break. But I dont know if I want that either. I want to make up for the lost years. I want back on the horse asap.

It's mentally and physically so hard to fail after you've given everything. Never the less, that's the risk.

**How do I get back on the horse when i'm not getting pumped by anything? My ""why"" is gone..**

**Update:**  
1st of all, i'm surprised by all the great answers. You are all awesome. It helps ALOT, and I feel blessed for all the insights.   
**What I'm doing now:** I'm taking a short break. But I've pretty certain that I will be digging myself a much bigger hole if I relax too long. So I will use the good days to move myself and my new ideas/business forward, and accept the bad days and relax.  As practical stuff i'm removing my phone for 30 days. I've learned som really toxic behaviors by checking emails constantly etc. I will also read even more (just started ""Switch"", recommended from this post). We've always said that we're a product of the 5 persons we most associate with, but in this same aspect I would rephrase this to: We are the product of the content we consume daily. And I have a few that has to go, if I want to move forward from this. It's important that I consume the right content now or else consume nothing. I'm restarting my gratitude journaling and joined fitness. This was previously a way for me to mentally refocus my brain and goals. And lastly: I will not push forward right now. From your advice i'm pretty certain I will feel it when I'm ""allowed"" to push again. I suspect it wont take very long. Thanks to everyone who helped. Lets do this.

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all feedback positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting** after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.** Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation? How did you figure out if it was time to seek validation in more dynamic markets? I need to connect with those who've been through this.

I'm reaching out to learn about the personal productivity stack that startup founders and C-level executives are using in their daily work. Specifically looking for insights from those running small to medium-sized startups.

Some aspects I'm particularly interested in:

* Task/project management tools
* Note-taking and knowledge management
* Time tracking and calendar tools
* Communication and collaboration tools
* Any other productivity hacks or tools you can't live without

Would love to hear:

1. Your role and company size
2. Your top 3-5 most frequently used tools
3. Why these tools work best for you
4. What's still missing or could be improved in your current workflow

I’ve been working on a new platform idea that connects people who have creative app ideas with developers who can bring those ideas to life. The twist? It’s not just about funding—it’s about **collaboration, trust, and sharing success**.

  
I have completed the core functionality development.

Here’s how it works:

* **Got an idea?** Let’s say you’ve always wanted an app for something specific. You can post your idea on the platform, and developers can pick it up if they think it’s feasible (and worth doing). If the community likes your idea, they can even invest in it, giving the developer the funds they need to make it happen.
* **For developers:** Developers can see which ideas have the most interest or funding **before starting work**, so they don’t waste time building something nobody wants. Plus, they can get funding upfront to help with the development process.
* **Revenue sharing:** When the app is launched, people who invested early can share in the revenue it generates. This gives everyone an incentive to support great ideas and help them succeed.
* **Credit and trust:** One of the key features I’m working on is a **credit rating system** for developers. Their “score” is based on their track record—apps they’ve completed, user satisfaction, and how well they’ve met deadlines. Over time, as the platform grows, this credit system will expand to include investors and idea contributors, so trust becomes a key part of the ecosystem.

I’ve already built the core of this platform, and a few developers are excited to join. They see it as a way to avoid the usual guesswork (or funding struggle) that comes with indie development.

Here’s where I need your input:

1. **Would you use a platform like this?** Maybe you have a cool idea you’d love to see made, or maybe you’d want to invest in apps you think could succeed.
2. **As a developer, does this sound like something you’d find helpful?** Would you be okay sharing revenue if it meant upfront funding and validation for your project?
3. **What would make this platform trustworthy?** (I know trust is a big deal when it comes to money and ideas.)

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any questions! I’m trying to make sure this solves real problems for both developers and users before I go all in.

,startups,"Hi everyone,

This will be a longer read, but I genuinely believe you’ll get a lesson or two out of it.

First off, I want to clarify that this post isn’t intended as an advertisement. If it does come off that way, I assure you that’s not my intention. We’re just trying to share our journey, insights, and some of the successes we've achieved so far. We’re actually not interested in taking on any additional clients right this second, which is why I’m not including our agency name or specific details about how to contact us.

Before I dive into the details, everything I’m about to share is based on actual results, client feedback, and hard-won experience. If you have questions or want more insight, feel free to reach out — I’m more than happy to chat and share details that could help.

Let’s dive in.

We run a lead generation agency focused on management agencies within a pretty unique field (rhymes with Only Sans). The industry itself isn’t widely discussed (morality debates are common), but it’s incredibly active. We operate differently from most service providers because we prioritize long-term value and genuine results over quick wins. With backgrounds in high-ticket sales, cold outreach, and lead generation, we’ve built systems that produce results few others in this space can offer.

**Operations and Services**

It’s been exactly a year since we launched, and in that time, we’ve had the chance to work with some of the more established agencies in the industry. By networking at conferences, participating in Q&amp;A sessions, and building relationships with experts, we’ve established a reputation as a reliable partner in this space.

Our approach is straightforward: we use Instagram to source, find, and connect with creators. By focusing exclusively on creators from first-world countries who already have a proven track record, we’re able to provide quality that typical marketplaces often don’t. Our goal is consistency and reliability; if a creator doesn’t work out, we provide a replacement to keep our clients covered. This has been key in helping us stand out in a crowded market.

Generally, our payment structure is designed to be flexible based on each client’s needs. We charge a base rate that scales with the number and type of creators the client requires, with custom packages available if they have specific niche or demographic preferences. This setup allows us to offer both straightforward solutions and tailored deals to meet diverse client needs while maintaining quality and reliability in the leads we deliver.

**Additional Services**

One thing we’ve learned is that adding complementary services has strengthened our client relationships. For example, if a client’s Instagram profile isn’t up to scratch, we offer rebranding support, which around 90% of clients take us up on. This additional service keeps clients engaged and reinforces our reputation for going above and beyond.

**How We’re Different from Marketplaces**

Marketplaces are technically our competition, but we’ve chosen a different approach. Most marketplaces rely on creators from lower-income countries, which often leads to issues around language barriers, commitment, and reliability. Once any initial guarantee ends, these creators may leave, creating a new set of challenges for agencies. Our focus is on creators who already speak fluent English, have a track record, and meet specific standards for quality and professionalism. Rather than signing on anyone, we make sure creators are a solid match for both our standards and the needs of our clients.

Interestingly, some marketplaces have approached us to partner, offering to sell our creators through their platforms in exchange for a commission. We decided against it, as it would dilute the exclusivity and reputation we’ve built. Instead, we recently found a way to partner through a white-label model, which allows us to expand our reach without compromising our brand or standards.

**Growth and Challenges**

We’ve built a community of over 800 agencies on Telegram in just a year, which has been invaluable for growth. But here’s the kicker: it’s only the two of us. My co-founder and I handle every single part of the operation — from marketing to client communications, sourcing leads, and fulfilling orders. It’s a heavy load, and while we’re no strangers to hard work, we know our time could be better spent if we had more systems in place. Right now, we’re turning away clients because we simply don’t have enough hours in the day.

Despite this, we’ve managed to generate over six figures in our first year, and we’re proud of it. However, we know we’re missing out on even more substantial growth — potentially an additional $50k/month — simply because we’re operating at maximum capacity.

**Our Scaling Goals**

The field we’re in isn’t easy, and it’s filled with companies that don’t always operate with the best practices. Our commitment to honest, reliable service has allowed us to build a strong client base. That said, we’re currently facing some financial challenges, partially due to the mistake of mixing personal and business finances early on. Not to mention, we’re handling everything from A to Z (client communication, lead sourcing/closing, marketing, etc.), which is extremely time-consuming. With capital, we’d be able to delegate most of the tasks, and the two of us could start prioritizing actual growth. This is why we’re seriously considering funding, to help us stabilize and make strategic moves for long-term growth.

We have a solid scaling plan that could allow us to reach $50k/month in revenue at minimum, mostly by expanding our Instagram outreach (running multiple accounts, each representing a creator). But we’d need support to set up the necessary systems to automate and scale efficiently.

**What We’re Looking For**

We’re at a point where we’re considering funding options to help us level up. Has anyone here been in a similar position? If you’ve navigated scaling a small team or managed exponential growth in a service-based startup, we’d love to hear about your experience. We’re even open to discussing equity if it makes sense for the right partner.

Any insights from fellow founders would be really appreciated.

I've been working so hard for a year and a 1/2, after my regular job, staying up late, reading at least thirty books on entrepreneurship, personal development and and marketing, building the prototype, marketing etc. And yet I can't even get one sale (product is under $300)and capturing emails has been a struggle. 
I know having a startup is hard, but i'm feeling discouraged. I'm not going to give up and I keep reading and trying, but this seems like such an obvious solution to a monster of a problem and i'm wondering why I'm having such a harder time marketing. Is it because it's different? 
I really need a test group to be able to finalize the product. I've given it for free to just a few people and they have benefited enormously from it. For the test group, I wanted people to pay just a little bit so that they would have skin in the game, but I can't find anyone to even pay a hundred dollars. Should I back off of trying to get them to pay, and just get the test group through for free? Then when i have that info,  ramp up marketing again? 
Any advice and/or encouragement would be awesome. I don't know if it's the approaching holiday, but i'm certainly feeling down about my progress so far.

,startups,"I am debating launching a company that helps small businesses navigate operations because it appears most suck at this unless they have one key employee who cares about efficiency and getting the work done.

I want it to be affordable - around $299 per month; something most companies would just subscribe to because there are no long term contracts.

I’ve found that startups don’t want to hire someone for this role because it's something the CEO typically takes on themselves. 

Small businesses, however, need this role, but they have trouble filling it; they too fall into the category of not having enough resources to allocate for an Operations position. 

This ends with small businesses running inefficient ops – ones riddled with “hurry” and “flying by the seat of their pants.”

Business owners don’t link operations and growth together either because they got to where they are today without having to.

Them leaning on a “this is the way we have always done things” mentality also stunts opportunity.

Businesses are not focused on the right things–like growth and the what the future may look like–because they are too occupied with day-today operations that are inefficient.

They are also leaving money on the table by ignoring quality (having to do work twice) and they posses a “reactionary” mindset instead of a “proactive” one. 

All three of these (and there are plenty of others) lead to burnout and stress.

I am brainstorming a two-fold solution.

First, there are plenty of workers out there with the same mindset of continuously getting work done faster and better out there, they just aren’t connected with small businesses.

Companies simply don’t know how and where to find them unless they fall into their lap or walk into the door (like my personal situation). 

If a small business had access to this talent at a low price, would they be at least interested in trying it out for one or two months?

I would want to connect this talent, as I believe it could at minimum expose a company to its various inefficiencies. 

Secondly, since hiring people is expensive and time consuming, would a streamlined approach to operations that equips business leaders with the tools they need to improve operations be impactful? Is it even important?

I would like to provide a product/service (not just training) that integrates an Operations mind into a company's day-to-day and long term goals.

,startups,"Hello! This is my first post so please go easy on me. 

I run a home service business that does $1.5m in revenue. We have been in business for 10 years as of last month. 

Over the years there have been MANY ups and downs, including nearly going out of business multiple times. Luckily, we have stabilized and now have a very healthy business. 

We have always had visions of being a national company but in our specific industry there seems to be an array of obstacles that make it nearly impossible to scale(we have tried many times). The only companies that do, do so by selling franchises. Franchises that turnover very often, due to franchisee burn out. 

As a tech person, I figured there had to be a better way using technology. 

So in the past 3 years I have been developing software that will mitigate the obstacles, giving a clear path to scalability. 

The software is essentially an OS/platform for our entire company to operate on. It makes everything more efficient and is designed specifically around our business operations. Instead of turning it into a SAAS I want to use it to scale and become the market leader in our industry. 

My question is simple: is this something a VC would be interested in? Or do they typically not invest in older companies?

We have: Live MVP, Team, Traction, Proven Business Model, Clear path to scalability 

You may ask why I need funding. 

Here is my answer:
I have bootstrapped for 10 years and have done everything in my power to keep this thing alive. We are currently profitable but in order to build this thing correctly I need to hire better talent and if I try to push for more revenue it gets harder to manage the software development. I need money to give me some breathing room.

Any and all feedback is welcome.

I’ve always had a knack for building websites—it’s a hobby that’s stuck with me over the years. And recently, I’ve realized that creating something useful for others is what really makes me happy. So, here I am, offering to build free websites for startups like yours.

No catch. No strings. Just tell me about your idea, your goals, and what you’re trying to achieve, and I’ll put my skills to work.

Why am I doing this? Honestly, I’m at a point in life where I want to do something that feels good, something that matters. And if my work helps you get your startup off the ground, that’s all the reward I need.

Of course, if you feel like tipping me after, I’d appreciate it—but it’s totally optional. My main goal is to support people chasing their dreams while I figure out my own.

1. Why are TAM, SAM, and SOM numbers necessary for a pre-seed pitch?
   * Are investors primarily looking at these to gauge ambition, feasibility, or something else?
2. Are there viable alternatives?a.
   *  If these figures are difficult to estimate at such an early stage, are there other metrics or narratives that can work instead?
3. How can I calculate and defend these numbers effectively?
   * What are realistic approaches to estimating these markets, especially in a domain that involves fragmented or emerging markets?
   * How can I ensure these numbers hold up to scrutiny without overpromising?

,startups,"I wanted to share my journey, especially with those of you working on your side projects and feeling stuck.

Before I started my web design agency as a side project, I failed at seven different business ideas.

Each failure was tough, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about giving up. But those failures turned out to be the best foundation for what I’m doing now. Here’s why:

**1. Every Failure Taught Me Something Valuable**  
Each of those seven businesses forced me to learn a new skill:

* A failed dropshipping store taught me the basics of copywriting.
* A print-on-demand project helped me understand customer research.
* Freelance gigs that flopped showed me how to manage budgets better.

When I launched my web design agency, all those skills came together and gave me a head start.

**2. I Learned to Focus on the Long Game**  
At first, I was chasing quick wins, jumping from idea to idea because I thought the next one would be “it.” Failing so many times forced me to slow down and focus on building something sustainable, even if it took longer.

**3. I Became Resilient**  
Let’s be real, rejection sucks. And after being ghosted by leads, hearing “no” over and over, and seeing months of work fail, it’s easy to want to quit. But failing taught me that rejection isn’t the end, it’s feedback to improve.

**4. I Realized It’s Okay to Fail Forward**  
One of my biggest failures was getting scammed out of $2.5k in a remote opportunity. That loss left me terrified of trying anything online again. But I eventually realized that failure wasn’t a dead end—it was a lesson to trust myself and do my due diligence better.

**5. I Finally Hit My Breakthrough**  
Fast forward to my current side hustle: a web design agency.

For the first 8 months, I struggled to get clients. I worked on everything:

* Creating an irresistible offer
* Improving my outreach process
* Practicing my design skills

Nothing clicked. Until one day, in the 9th month, it all came together.

I closed 3 deals in 6 days, making my first 4 figures online. That wouldn’t have been possible without the skills and resilience I built from those earlier failures.

If you’re stuck on your side project or feeling like it’s not going anywhere, here’s what I’ve learned:

* Every failure is feedback. use it.
* Build skills that transfer, even if this project doesn’t work out.
* Focus on why you’re building your project, not just the outcome.

Most importantly: Don’t quit. You’re probably closer to your breakthrough than you realize.

&lt;li&gt;A print-on-demand project helped me understand customer research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelance gigs that flopped showed me how to manage budgets better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I launched my web design agency, all those skills came together and gave me a head start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. I Learned to Focus on the Long Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
At first, I was chasing quick wins, jumping from idea to idea because I thought the next one would be “it.” Failing so many times forced me to slow down and focus on building something sustainable, even if it took longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I Became Resilient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Let’s be real, rejection sucks. And after being ghosted by leads, hearing “no” over and over, and seeing months of work fail, it’s easy to want to quit. But failing taught me that rejection isn’t the end, it’s feedback to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. I Realized It’s Okay to Fail Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
One of my biggest failures was getting scammed out of $2.5k in a remote opportunity. That loss left me terrified of trying anything online again. But I eventually realized that failure wasn’t a dead end—it was a lesson to trust myself and do my due diligence better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. I Finally Hit My Breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Fast forward to my current side hustle: a web design agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first 8 months, I struggled to get clients. I worked on everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an irresistible offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving my outreach process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing my design skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing clicked. Until one day, in the 9th month, it all came together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I closed 3 deals in 6 days, making my first 4 figures online. That wouldn’t have been possible without the skills and resilience I built from those earlier failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re stuck on your side project or feeling like it’s not going anywhere, here’s what I’ve learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every failure is feedback. use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build skills that transfer, even if this project doesn’t work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on why you’re building your project, not just the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly: Don’t quit. You’re probably closer to your breakthrough than you realize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else here find that past failures helped them get where they are now? I’d love to hear your stories.&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"Hi guys,

I’m seeking some advice on a challenge we’re facing with our software platform. It’s a B2B2C solution that I currently sell in my home country, and from time to time, we get interest from users in other countries who really like it and propose ideas for expanding abroad.

Recently, we were approached by someone from the US who’s genuinely enthusiastic and wants to help sell our solution there. We’ve agreed on terms, and while it’s exciting, we’re facing a specific challenge: currency support.

Our platform currently only supports euros, and building multicurrency functionality would require significant development work. However, our team is very small right now—we’ve had to scale back due to layoffs while extending our runway to close the next funding round.

Given these constraints, we’re considering a shortcut: creating a separate instance of the platform just for the US. This would simplify the process for now and allow us to test the waters without major investments in development.

That said, this trial comes with risks. For one, we’re not even sure if the guy will manage to sell anything. On top of that, I’m struggling to decide whether we should:
	1.	Use a different product name or domain for the US version to avoid confusion.
	2.	Stick with the same name and branding, but risk scenarios where European customers might stumble upon the US site and create unnecessary headaches (e.g., trying to log in or place orders on the wrong version).

I wanted to share something that might spark some interesting discussion! We've built a tool that completely automates text extraction, translation, and seamless repositioning for images - and we've managed to cut localization costs and time by 80% for comic publishers. We have a strong background in computer vision, so this was within our expertise.

Our current focus has been comic publishing where manual translation was a massive pain point. We've proven the tech works, reduced operational friction, and are on the cusp of generating solid revenue. But here's where I'm looking for your collective wisdom: **Where else could this technology make a meaningful impact?**

Some initial thoughts I've had:

* Manga and graphic novel publishers
* Educational textbooks with complex diagrams
* Technical manuals with embedded text
* Packaging for international product markets

But I'm certain there are verticals I'm not seeing. Our current core tech is basically:

1. Intelligent text extraction from complex image layouts
2. Contextual translation with very high quality
3. Pixel-perfect text replacement
4. User can edit the result and our tool will reposition the updated text perfectly

Would love to hear from founders who:

* Have experience scaling niche tech solutions
* See potential use cases I might be overlooking
* Have navigated similar pivot/expansion challenges

,startups,"At least once a week there's a question here asking about equity split between founders.  The only fair answer is Slicing Pie (google it because the first time I posted this, mods took it down)

I say this as someone who:

1. Had to buy out my co-founder at my first startup and
2. Who is now using Slicing Pie

I won't dive into the details of Slicing Pie (unless anyone has any questions) but I'll tell you why its the only way I'll do things.

I started my first startup with a guy who was an excellent developer. We're both really good techies but he had much more skill than I did and helped bring a lot of ideas to the product.  However, he ended up losing interest after we launched the product because he somehow believed that the money would just start flowing on its own.   When that didn't happen he became less and less involved until he ultimately abandoned the company altogether.

The story has a happy ending, because I bought him out and moved on, but it was a super huge pain in the ass and overly contentious in ways it didn't need to be.  It could have gone much worse, however, because ownership was set at 60/40 and he could have held on until the end and caused all sorts of headache.

This is where the right application of Slicing Pie would have allowed for everything to go much more smoothly.

First, the entire premise behind Slicing Pie is that your ownership is based on what you contribute.  Depending on how you set it up, contributions can be in the form of time, expenses, or some other value provided.  To keep it simple: if you work 1000 hours and your co-founder works 500 hours, then you have 2x the equity.

In some situations, someone might say ""but my hour is worth more"".  Sure, if your anticipated salary is more expensive, then you can set it up so your hours count for more money.

Others might say ""well, my \*value\* provided to the company is more"" (for instance, sales vs. code).  That's fine, too. For us, we have things set up so there's a deferred commission scheme. With a commission of 5%, the person who gets the sale can put all of that cash back into the company, but consider that amount to be part of the overall fund.

The best part of Slicing Pie is that if you don't contribute, you don't get squat and if you do contribute, you get the value you give.

The 2nd best part is if someone decides they're not interested anymore, or they're unable to keep the prior pace, or something else happens, their stake in the company is continually diminished.

On this latter point, i don't recommend just saying you're using Slicing Pie. You need to form your initial agreements around it.  There's a bunch of resources and sample agreements on the Slicing Pie website.   What we did at my latest company is base the entire Operating Agreement around one of the agreements on that page.  We then went over it with our lawyer to customize things for us and to make sure everything was in compliance with the state we're formed in.

Two of the more important parts in our Operating Agreement are that we have the ability to remove someone who has abandoned the company and we can drag them along on investment, or M&amp;A.  In the case of abandonment, they can then also be bought out for FMV of their contribution. In the case of a drag along, that's just a standard drag along.

All in all I can't think of a more fair way of determining equity and avoiding conflict. And I never would have heard about it had it not been for people mentioning it here on r/startups",t2_3o16sl1w,False,,0,False,Slicing Pie is the answer,[],r/startups,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1h0jfmd,False,light,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},I will not promote,False,8,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1732646946.0,text,6,,,text,self.startups,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least once a week there&amp;#39;s a question here asking about equity split between founders.

,startups,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling in my current role and could use some advice.

In March 2024, I joined a very early-stage startup as the first employee and Growth Lead. Before this, I was the first Growth hire at a successful startup with a similar business model but in a different industry. While the salary here is decent for the company stage, it’s nowhere near my previous salary.

Lately, I’ve started to lose motivation and confidence in the company and the founders. Here’s why:

The founders are slow to make decisions, especially on strategic priorities. Urgent matters are discussed in meetings but rarely followed up with action.  
  
I seem to be the only one implementing processes and ensuring the team sticks to them. For example, we have a cold-calling session with the Sales team, but if I’m not actively involved and making sure it happens, no one does it. The founder in charge of Sales doesn’t seem to care.

It’s a mobile app, but there’s no CTO or technical founder. Development is outsourced to an agency, resulting in sporadic feature releases. Communication with the agency has become increasingly difficult, and most releases come with significant bugs.

The founders’ mood is worsening, and they seem increasingly overwhelmed, mostly due to cash flow concerns and underwhelming performance metrics.

I was initially promised 2% equity, but after a board meeting, it was revised to 1%. I still haven’t signed the paperwork as I'm waiting for them to give me the contract... They also revised my bonus to only give me the smallest tier, even though they say my performance was great.

I can’t control how the business performs, but it feels like my career is tied to its success. I’m losing motivation as my confidence in the leadership and company vision declines and ultimately I feel underpaid for everything I'm doing and how much effort I put in the startup...  
  
Is there anything I can do to improve the situation, or should I start looking elsewhere?

Cost savings: Potential for economies of scale and reduced risk.

Second, **they weren’t listening to customers.** Instead of focusing on what the customer needed, they were too focused on pitching the product. This led to missed opportunities to connect with potential buyers.

A small team apparently took 10 months to create a very low quality app that competes for the same market , I’ll say their app is usable but very much lacking and feels cheap,unorganized and i think unworthy of payment .

Ether way the idea was to lunch an app that targets chefs and private food makers and have a stable booking systems with customers and easy tracking .

I have been working to make the app very much fit for Chefs and Private Food Makers , for example I added a way to see different menus, compare prices and the app in general is curated with its UI as a food app where clicking on “sea food” shows fish animations and etc .

All of this are more bonus to the Booking/customer tracking we have done .

My idea was to expand the app from chefs to Doctors to Car people etc and make it a “private vendor” handyman type app .

Now the competitors lunched their version which pretty much includes everything, ie chefs , barbershops, yoga,doctors pretty much they made a booking handyman app (no tracking and i tested their app it’s mvp basic even worst) ,

,startups,"Hi everybody! I’ve recently thrown myself back to pursuing a new venture after having done it once. It’s been 3 months since the last, so definitely feels addictive and exciting :)

**So what problem am I trying to solve ?**

The problem I’m trying to solve is something that I experienced so many times in my previous venture, both internally and whilst working with 3rd party partners. And that’s the common challenge of internal manual ops workflows that although not part of the core IP tend to have the following negative impacts:

* Lost of customers - typically as the result of slow internal processes e.g slow customer service support
* Large operational overheard - manual workflows often requires large head counts which is costly or sometimes simply infeasible
* Costly mistake and poor collaboration - manual workflows can often lead to costly mistakes and poor collaboration between teams.

**What’s the solution ?**

Well the solution to many of these manual workflows tends to be automation, however this is not always easy because of challenges such as:

* Inadequate tooling - tools like Zapier (have used it myself) are great but more tailored workflows tend to require custom code which can be tricky with these type of tools
* Different needs for different teams - each team has unique workflows and build custom automations for each team is infeasible
* Not part of engineering priorities - engineering is often focused on product requirements and doesn’t have time for internal tools

**What am I building to solve this ?**

An AI-powered platform that allows you yo automate any operational workflow simply by drawing and describing the process workflow.

So imagine all those nitty gritty manual tasks that are either costing you time or money, with what we are building no matter how custom it is, if you can draw the process workflow, describe it, the platform will give you an automated version of it which you can then deploy internally just with the push of a button. We want to make it simple for day-to-day founders and small business to custom automations with no coding or expertise required.

I would love to engage with anyone who would love to be apart of the beta testing as we ramp up the first version (schedule for release after the Christmas break). Moreover I would love your feedback on the above, what uses-cases would you want to automate on such a platform.

Curious about something and hoping to get your thoughts!  
I'm a bit of a podcast junkie (have spoken on a couple and easily consume 100+ a month), but lately, I've been hitting a wall finding short and good audio content that really scratches my specific interests.

So I've been experimenting with something: using AI tools to generate short, focused audio snippets about topics I'm genuinely curious about. Nothing too polished, just quick, informative 10-minute audio clips. And It's been surprisingly enjoyable!

I started thinking about building a quick prototype of an app (I'm an experienced software engineer) to do this for everybody: a daily 10min audio/podcast about either news or subjects of interest for people to listen to while commuting to work.

Assuming the audio/podcast quality is indistinguishable from real humans, would love to know:

1. Would you be more interested in hyper-personalized content about your specific interests, or quick daily news summaries?
2. What's the sweet spot for length? 10 min? 15?

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, after reading Zero to One by Peter Thiel, (which is one of the best books I&amp;#39;ve ever read) I don&amp;#39;t even know if it&amp;#39;s a good idea.

I'm at the point in getting my new startup off the ground that I need to find a more technical partner. I've been all over Linkedin and Upwork but haven't had any success in finding the right person yet. I'm hoping ya'll can point me in the right direction to find this person.

My business is a simple services company in which clients can hire assistants through us. We have a unique list of first clients that are keen to buy from us. I'm currently managing everything in Google sheets. I need a partner that's built a customer journey system from the ground up using simple tools, but in a way that leaves room for us to scale in the future.

Ideally, the person I'm looking for wants to build something from the ground up, is open to coming on as a full time tech lead in the future, and is in a time zone similar to the US. I'd really like to work with someone in their mid to late 20s who is ready for their chance to own something. The reason I want someone in LATAM is both financial and because that's where a large part of our business is coming from.

I tried using arcdev, and similar sites, but a lot of these sites require a business domain to make an account. I'm still operating totally out of gmail and haven't even bought a domain yet so I can't get into these sites.

Where would you go to find someone like this?

The other reason I'm having trouble is because this isn't necessarily a developer, or a designer, or a PM but someone who can do it all to start out. It seems like a lot of technical folks are really niched-out especially as they get more senior in their careers so I'm not sure what type of role to be posting int he first place.

,startups,"If you’re struggling to attract a technical co-founder, it might be because your idea lacks clarity or validation.

Developers are problem-solvers, not fortune-tellers. They need to see evidence that your idea addresses a real market need, has traction, or is backed by a clear execution plan. 

Unrealistic expectations, vague pitches, or equity-heavy offers without upfront commitment can make them hesitant. Want to win them over? Validate your concept, respect their expertise, and show you’re just as invested in the journey as they are.

Here is the framework I use:

1. Low-cost prototype creation ($100-$500)

* Clickable UI mockups
* Core user flows
* Basic branding



1. Customer validation sprint (2-3 weeks)

* 20+ user interviews
* Market sizing
* Competitor analysis
* Revenue projections



1. Find technical co-founder with proof

* Validated prototype
* User feedback data
* Revenue model
* Clear technical scope



# Equity Recommendation

* If you’ve done the work listed (prototyping, validation, and planning), consider negotiating **35-45% equity** for the technical co-founder rather than 50%.

* However, 50% may still be fair if:
   * The product is highly complex and demands extensive development.
   * The technical co-founder is also taking on operational or strategic roles.
   * The project requires significant long-term technical investment.

  
Equity decisions should ultimately reflect the value of each person’s contributions and align incentives for the company’s success.

Hi everyone, I’m reaching out for advice on what to do in my current situation. First, a little about me: I’m an Argentinian entrepreneur who studied at the University of Georgia. My time there was the best experience of my life, and I made some amazing friends. One of those friends and I always talked about starting a business importing vehicle parts and agricultural machinery to Argentina.

For different reasons (like the pandemic), we couldn’t move forward at the time, but about a year ago, we finally started working on this project seriously. On my side, I managed to get everything ready: I hired trade specialists, customs brokers, and sales agents, and I even had several potential orders lined up.

Unfortunately, just a few days ago, my friend told me he got a great job offer in another state and won’t be able to continue with the business. I’m happy for him, but this has left me in a tough spot. I invested all my savings into this, got my visa, bought flights, reserved an apartment and car—all for February, when I planned to visit the US to get things started. Now, I feel like I have nothing left.

This is where I could really use your advice.

Should I just cut my losses, cancel the trip, and move on?
If you think I should continue, what are some places, conventions, or events where I could meet entrepreneurs interested in selling their products in Argentina (or even importing from here)?
I’m open to any suggestions. I don’t care if I have to go to Atlanta, Alaska, or any other place—if it means making just one solid contact to keep moving forward, I’m ready to do whatever it takes. I just don’t want to give up after coming this far and involving so many people on this side of the project.

We have successfully completed several complex projects in the past and are currently working on a challenging project for a client in the UK a platform for fantasy football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this, I came up with an idea to build a gaming platform. As we can see, Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia, are rapidly evolving and modernizing. The gaming industry in the region is also experiencing significant growth. After extensive research, I have outlined a unique set of features and functionalities for this platform that are not commonly found in competing platforms. I strongly believe this idea has the potential to be a major success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, feel free to reach out I would be excited to share more details about the idea with you. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"Hello,

I've worked on this product (exercising product) for around 2.5 yrs now. I took it really slow, and spent around +$15k in the development, all done by myself (and I have no prior experience developing an electronic product). the product consists of a PCBA + Enclosure + Rubber parts + Fiberglass parts. I worked directly with manufacturers in China. and after so many iterations, we were able to make the final samples.

a Quick breakdown:

**PCBA + Firmware** \- I hired a freelancer to make it, then manufactured it with both JLCPCB + a CM that i found in Alibaba.

**Enclosure** \- I hired a freelancer to design it - then 3d printed it.

**Rubber parts** \- I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - it took several molds and attempts till we got it right.

**Fiberglass parts** \- I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - and we got it right pretty quick.

I assembled the product many times that i can do it blindfolded now. I tested every aspect physically, improved the design, and got rid of things that are not necessary.

I have shown the product to people around me for testing and feedback. They liked it and the feedback was really positive. The product is really good, and exceeded all expectations (there is nothing like it in the market).

I kept the product in secret mode the majority of the time, the only person who knew 90% of the functionality was the freelancer who made the Firmware/Software for me, and he is a person that i personally trust.

I'm currently preparing a provisional patent, to start sharing the full idea with the manufacturer that will handle the manufacturing + assembly.

The product is not complicated and is very easy to understand.. IP thieves will have to figure how we did the silicon + fiberglass + firmware, in order to bring something similar to the market. My main goal is to be the first to market and not worry about these.

Now, i have the product in my hands, and don't know what to do next. it might not be the perfect version, but i think its +90% of that. and honestly, i cannot improve it any further..

The CM i found in Alibaba said that they can help with PCBA + Enclosure + Final product Assembly (after receiving the parts) + Packaging + Certifications. But, i don't know if i can trust them (They are well-known and verified though).

I keep asking myself these questions:

\- Should i go with one of these CMs? show them the product and start managing the process myself between factories ? (i don't want to give them the full responsibility - For IP)

\- What certifications will we need (we used ESP32 Module)? and how are we going to obtain it? and how can it be verified? what if we make slight modifications later to the PCBA, will we have to re-obtain these again?

\- What if the product/Assembly isn't 100% perfect? Will that matter for the first Batches? For Example: There might be a better and more reliable way to assemble certain parts and we haven't discovered it yet (even if its currently working fine).

I would appreciate any help from people who had similar experiences.

Thanks!",t2_10rpsx,False,,0,False,Manufacturing an electronic product in China,[],r/startups,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1gyzt48,False,light,0.94,,public,22,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},I will not promote,False,22,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1732477995.0,text,6,,,text,self.startups,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked on this product (exercising product) for around 2.5 yrs now. I took it really slow, and spent around +$15k in the development, all done by myself (and I have no prior experience developing an electronic product). the product consists of a PCBA + Enclosure + Rubber parts + Fiberglass parts. I worked directly with manufacturers in China. and after so many iterations, we were able to make the final samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a Quick breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCBA + Firmware&lt;/strong&gt; - I hired a freelancer to make it, then manufactured it with both JLCPCB + a CM that i found in Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure&lt;/strong&gt; - I hired a freelancer to design it - then 3d printed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rubber parts&lt;/strong&gt; - I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - it took several molds and attempts till we got it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiberglass parts&lt;/strong&gt; - I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - and we got it right pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assembled the product many times that i can do it blindfolded now. I tested every aspect physically, improved the design, and got rid of things that are not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have shown the product to people around me for testing and feedback. They liked it and the feedback was really positive. The product is really good, and exceeded all expectations (there is nothing like it in the market).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept the product in secret mode the majority of the time, the only person who knew 90% of the functionality was the freelancer who made the Firmware/Software for me, and he is a person that i personally trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently preparing a provisional patent, to start sharing the full idea with the manufacturer that will handle the manufacturing + assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product is not complicated and is very easy to understand.. IP thieves will have to figure how we did the silicon + fiberglass + firmware, in order to bring something similar to the market. My main goal is to be the first to market and not worry about these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, i have the product in my hands, and don&amp;#39;t know what to do next. it might not be the perfect version, but i think its +90% of that. and honestly, i cannot improve it any further..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CM i found in Alibaba said that they can help with PCBA + Enclosure + Final product Assembly (after receiving the parts) + Packaging + Certifications. But, i don&amp;#39;t know if i can trust them (They are well-known and verified though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep asking myself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Should i go with one of these CMs? show them the product and start managing the process myself between factories ? (i don&amp;#39;t want to give them the full responsibility - For IP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- What certifications will we need (we used ESP32 Module)? and how are we going to obtain it? and how can it be verified? what if we make slight modifications later to the PCBA, will we have to re-obtain these again?&lt;/p&gt;

My startup is incorporated as a Delaware C-Corp, but the VC doesn't have prior experience investing in U.S.-based startups, so we're navigating this together.

I have a few questions and would appreciate any advice:

1) Should I use a U.S. SAFE (since we're a Delaware C-Corp) or consider a Singapore SAFE given the VC's location?

2) Are there any legal or tax implications I should be aware of when receiving funding from a non-U.S. VC?

3) Is now the right time to bring in a lawyer to guide me through the process?

,startups,"Hi All,

As someone who's long had entrepreneurial ambitions, I've finally settled on a project after years of consideration. I have detailed a business plan, along with other documents to lay out my startup. I was hoping to get some advice on funding options so that I am able to make this work. The main difficulty I have is that my idea is largely service-sector based, and without funds, I am not able to start up / demonstrate application. For reference, my target is roughly £50-70k (depending on the scale of launch).

My current thoughts are:

Personal savings: Although I don't currently have the financial capacity for an investment of this amount, I could reach this goal within 2 or so years. However, that would be a significant delay, which is rather demotivating.

Angel investor: At the minute, my project is a mere idea. Without the funds, I am not able to demonstrate actionable application, which would make this very difficult.

Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding has provided many businesses with amazing opportunities. However, similar to angel investors, it's very difficult to galvanize the support of people without having something immediate to offer.

I would appreciate any advice on this—are there perhaps other options I've not considered? Are there ways to overcome the difficulties in my current methods?

At the moment, crowdfunding stands out to me as the most viable option. My project addresses various social objectives, which I feel could gain support from people. How am I able to promote my idea (besides platforms like Kickstarter)?

IT teams today are bogged down by fragmented tools, reactive troubleshooting, and escalating downtime costs. This hampers innovation, inflates operational expenses, and delays business growth.

We’re building something game-changing: an **AI/ML-powered platform** that transforms IT operations with:  
✔️ **Proactive issue prevention** via real-time anomaly detection.  
✔️ **Automated remediation**, reducing resolution time by up to **90%**.  
✔️ **Unified monitoring**, integrating infrastructure, apps, and services into a single-pane-of-glass dashboard.  
✔️ Advanced **network automation**, with features like configuration drift detection, root cause analysis, and dynamic topology mapping.

The goal? **Less firefighting, more innovation.** With faster ROI, **30–40% cost savings**, and seamless scalability across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we aim to redefine IT operations.

In this first version, the app is basically Reddit for skincare where users can make posts about different topics and interact with each other. Only photos are allowed, no video. We've recently launched this MVP on the Google and App stores (search 'Skincentric' if interested).

So far, we have 76 users and counting. I've had in depth conversations with our users and they're noticing some of the UI flaws with the app. For example, the scrolling is choppy and pages re-query every time you click to a new one so it never saves the position. Also, we'd like to implement video into the app but that has been a challenge. When we did add video, it slowed the app down drastically. At first, we used Firebase to store the video files, then we were advised to use Supabase but found little difference with SB.

So, we're wondering if cutting out FlutterFlow and just hard coding everything in Dart will help control/solve performance issues?

,startups,"Hi Reddit, I’d love your advice on this.

Background: I’m 25 and currently work in a mid-range management consulting firm (not top-tier ones like McKinsey). Back in 2019, during my second year of college, I started a startup that gained a lot of positive attention. We even pitched it to our state CM, who was impressed. Things were going well, especially during COVID when the team and I could work extensively from home. Our efforts yielded good results.

However, in my final year of college, I had to prioritize getting a job through campus placements because my parents weren’t supportive financially. My father is toxic and abusive, and I needed stability. While my co-founders wanted to go all-in on the startup, I couldn’t join them due to a lack of capital and parental support. They eventually left the startup but still hold shares. The company is still running (minimal revenue), but I’m funding it myself to keep it afloat.

Now, I’ve moved out of my parents’ house but still can’t quit my job since my father is retiring, and as the eldest child, I need to help my family financially. Despite this, I can’t shake off my entrepreneurial spirit.

Question:
I’ve been mentoring kids through Nasscom Foundation and helping friends with their ventures, and I’ve found a deep passion for it. The work aligns with my consulting job, and I’ve become good at problem-solving and structuring strategies. For instance, I was paid well for a two-month part-time consulting gig with Nasscom.

Recently, I helped a friend, and they suggested I start a side hustle offering consulting services. This idea resonates with me because it could create a side income to help me eventually leave my job and fully pursue my venture. My main interest lies in tech for good.

I’m looking for a technical founding partner for a project in the music equipment space. I have experience in design within this category and a few strong ideas that I believe could form the basis of a successful business.

I’m seeking advice on how best to approach finding the right person for this role. My initial idea is to create a short pitch deck (2-3 pages) that explains:

* My vision for the project
* The type of technical support I need
* Why this concept has potential

I’d then share this with my network to start the search, but I’m not sure how effective this approach will be.

For the technical folks here:

* What would you like to see in a pitch deck from a potential partner?
* How would you prefer to be approached about an opportunity like this?

,startups,"Hi everyone!

As founders, we often wear multiple hats—visionary, manager, marketer, and even developer. But one of the toughest challenges I’ve faced (and seen others face) is managing time effectively. Here are three strategies that have helped me stay focused and productive:

1. Prioritize ruthlessly: Not all tasks are created equal. I use the 80/20 rule to focus on the 20% of tasks that drive 80% of results. For example, spending time on customer feedback is usually more impactful than tweaking internal processes.

2. Time blocking: I block specific hours for deep work, meetings, and even breaks. By giving structure to my day, I avoid the trap of reacting to every notification or email.

3. Delegate and automate: It’s tempting to do everything yourself, but as your business grows, you need to trust your team and invest in tools that automate repetitive tasks. This frees up your time for strategic thinking.

What we've seen:

Our company wwwdotanother-fucking-saasdotcom

we've gotten emails from people asking if the job offers are real, coming from domains like

wwwdotanother-fucking-saasdotshop

wwwdotanother-fucking-saas-hiringdotbiz

etc

The obvious thing to do is buy as many TLD's as we can, but SLD's we're just kinda shit outta luck. Any time we see another TLD sending emails I write to the domain provider and they shut it down pretty quickly, but it's fucking whack-a-mole.

The part that I really don't know HOW to manage though, is the linkedin and google mail spam. People are catfishing/impersonating our real employees and sending job offers to people.

Unfortunately, I'm the closest thing to IT that we have...since I'm building the product, I'm the 'computer guy'. I'm OK doing this, but unfortunately I don't actually know WHAT to do. I reached out to an old CTO and he said to buy every TLD under the sun, so check there I guess.

But, as far as Linkedin, general catfishing, is there ANYTHING we can do other than ignore it all? I'm worried it's making us look bad. How common is this with other growing startups/businesses? Are we just unlucky? Or is this just what happens at this stage?

I'm thinking about buying a company that does text to speech (like speechify, but smaller). Hoping to list some key facts and get perspectives as I need to decide soon. Let me know if you want other information (I know I'm leaving a lot out, but trying to focus on the major concerns):

* Annual recurring revenue (ARR) has been slightly declining for 18 months (-7%/year)
* nearly 2k trials in the last year with 29% conversion rate
* net churn is 25% (ouch) - exit survey indicates apathy with product, mismatch of expectations, bugs, and missing features are the main causes of cancellation

,startups,"I dedicated two years of my life to a startup that ultimately failed. We were trying to build a mobile app which would simplify the life of people with diabetes. The whole journey was interesting but also a tough experience, so here are the mistakes I made and the valuable lessons I learned:

1. **All founders were technical:**
   * We were three founders, all technical, with no experience or motivation for marketing and sales.
   * A team needs balance. You can’t ignore the business side of things.
2. **Overcomplicating the MVP:**
   * We built way too many features and developed the app simultaneously for both Android and iOS.
   * It would have been much better to validate the idea on a single platform and focus on one core feature first.
3. **No competition isn’t a good thing:**
   * We did a research of competitors but we haven't find any. We thought a lack of competitors was a sign of opportunity, but it should be a warning sign instead. If no one else is in the space, it most of the time means there’s no demand for a product like this.
4. **Skipping idea validation and feedback:**
   * We didn’t validate our idea or gather feedback from potential users.
   * If we’d spent a few weeks talking to people, we could’ve identified their real pain points and built something they actually needed.
5. **Ignoring monetization:**
   * We didn’t think about how we’d make money at all. We should think about that from the start.
6. **No dedicated marketing effort:**
   * We spent hundreds of hours building the product but no one was focused on marketing.
   * You need someone on the team who would put as much effort into marketing as the developers do into building.
7. **Changing habits of your users is extremely hard:**
   * Our product required users to change their routines which is a huge challenge. A better approach would’ve been solving a problem they already had, not trying to create new behaviors.
8. **Wasting money on tools and infrastructure:**
   * We spent quite a lot of money on hosting, email services, certifications, legal entity creation and servers. If we'd do a better research, we could get a lot of these tools for free or at least cheaper.
9. **No energy for marketing after launch:**
   * We spent so much time and energy developing the product that by the time we launched, we were exhausted and demotivated.
   * Marketing is critical at launch, but we didn’t have the energy to start when it mattered most.
10. **Underestimating the importance of networking:**

   * We didn’t actively seek out mentors, advisors, or partnerships that could have guided us or opened doors.
   * Building connections with the people that are already in the industry might have helped us validate our idea and find early adopters.

**Key takeaways:**  
Balance your team. Keep your MVP simple. Talk to users early. Dedicate as much effort to marketing as you do to development, and don’t underestimate the power of networking.

,startups,"Got quoted $800 for a provisional patent this year working with . Being stubborn (and at the time, broke), we started playing with AI to see if it could help structure patent applications properly.

Spent months learning USPTO formatting requirements and feeding different patterns to the AI. Most attempts were garbage. The breakthrough came when I figured out how to make it structure technical descriptions properly.

Weird turn of events: Was showing a friend (who works at a SV patent firm) my terrible attempts, and his response surprised me: ""This... actually follows proper format?""

Now that same firm is testing it. It's been surreal seeing attorneys actually use something I built while messing around.

Current state:

\- Drafts basic provisional patents (working with firm on full patent app generator)

\- Actually works (shocking)

\- Lots of security issues to fix

\- Still figuring out next steps

Lessons learned:

1. Patent formatting is weirdly specific
2. AI hallucinates technical details a lot
3. Lawyers spend too much time on initial drafts
4. Security/privacy is everything with IP

The fun part has been seeing test inventions people try - ""AI-powered socks that sort themselves"" is still my favorite 😂

Would love feedback from anyone who's dealt with patents before. Still lots to figure out.

Also not sure on GTM. Thinking initially was target founders but there's not many that need patents and those that do are serious about it and will hire firm.... Thinking now is maybe lawyers will use this internally but other than my friend, most firms have not been very receptive to incorporating AI into their workflow....

Being stubborn (and at the time, broke), we started playing with AI to see if it could help structure patent applications properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent months learning USPTO formatting requirements and feeding different patterns to the AI. Most attempts were garbage. The breakthrough came when I figured out how to make it structure technical descriptions properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird turn of events: Was showing a friend (who works at a SV patent firm) my terrible attempts, and his response surprised me: &amp;quot;This... actually follows proper format?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that same firm is testing it. It&amp;#39;s been surreal seeing attorneys actually use something I built while messing around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Drafts basic provisional patents (working with firm on full patent app generator)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Actually works (shocking)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Lots of security issues to fix&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Still figuring out next steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patent formatting is weirdly specific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI hallucinates technical details a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawyers spend too much time on initial drafts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security/privacy is everything with IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun part has been seeing test inventions people try - &amp;quot;AI-powered socks that sort themselves&amp;quot; is still my favorite 😂&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"I've been thinking about an idea and wanted to get some feedback on its feasibility and whether it might have any real business demand. The concept involves using AI to personalize songs by replacing part or all of the lyrics while preserving the original artist's unique vocal style.

The idea is to uses AI to change lyrics in a song while keeping the original artist's unique voice and style. For example, if there’s a song where the artist sings someone’s name, this system could swap that name out for a different one, and it’ll still sound like the same artist singing it, with the same tone, style, and emotion. This could be used in music streaming platforms to create personalized song, or in apps like TikTok to generate custom audio tracks for user-generated content.

How It Works:
The AI is trained using recordings of the artist’s voice, along with the musical scores and lyrics (or phonemes). This helps the system learn how the artist sings—like their tone, pitch, and timing.
When it’s time to make changes, the program takes the original song, separates the voice from the instruments, and identifies the part of the vocal line to change. Then, using the new lyrics and pitch details from the original song, it generates a new vocal segment that sounds just like the artist. This new piece is added back to the song, replacing the old section.

Example Use Case:
Imagine a song where the artist sings, “Happy birthday, Sarah.” With this system, you could change ""Sarah"" to another name, like ""David,"" and it would still sound like the same artist singing it. The rest of the song stays untouched—same voice, same style, same everything—just a new name in the lyrics.

It could also be used to:

Localize songs into different languages while keeping the artist's original singing style.

Create clean versions of songs by swapping out explicit lyrics.

This is an easy way to personalize or adapt music without needing the artist to re-record anything.

This process can currently be achieved through methods like recording a new version of the song with the desired lyrics and then use voice conversion, or through extensive audio editing and manual adjustments. However, my goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient approach that automates this process using AI, making it faster and more accessible while maintaining the quality and authenticity of the original performance.

Some context: I started a SAAS to solve a simple but critical problem - helping DTC brands keep their customer data longer than the 7-day cookie window that's killing most mobile marketing efforts. We basically help brands implement server-side tracking and better use their first-party data for Meta ads and email marketing.

This means we were sitting on a goldmine of behavioral data (think millions of pre-purchase signals) and didn't even know it. We're the first point of interaction between customers and brands after all! This realization led to spending \~4 mo analyzing trends across our biggest performance wear clients.

What we found was fascinating:

* Cult sports are completely changing how brands succeed
* Traditional marketing playbooks are becoming obsolete
* First-party data is creating massive competitive advantages

And the numbers to back it all up.  
  
I ended up compiling our findings in to a whitepaper and started sharing it exclusively with industry leaders. The response was insane: **7x growth in inbound leads, multiple enterprise brands reaching out, speaking opportunities at industry events**

Key lessons learned:

1. Sometimes your best asset isn't your product, but your position in the market
2. Data without insight is just numbers
3. Sharing knowledge builds more trust than traditional marketing (!!!!!)

,startups,"Hi guys, I previously co-founded a startup and I'm exploring a few ideas as I prepare to jump back in :)

As startup and one of the challenging things to manage was internal operations especially given that it was a fintech driven business serving merchants. As is usual with many startups there were a number of manual operational workflows, but where it becomes a bit challenging is when some of these manual workflows although not part of your IP start to slow you down, but given your resources you unfortunately cannot dedicate resources for said development, so you piece workarounds. Internal drag-and-drop tools can sometimes help but for more complex workflows can be hard to work with.

These challenges sometimes tend to get better as you grow but typically at the expense of an increased head count and bloated operations costs. Which can hinder growth, I have seen this manual workflows persists at both and even some large companies so no one is immune. These manual workflows can range anywhere from internal customer onboarding, data entry, data transformation tasks to mundane sales and marketing ops tasks and sometimes when not done optimally can be costly, I remember how painful it was when we lost a few merchants due to some of the challenges above.

So I would love to open a discussion regarding how do you currently manage internal ops workflows especially with the advent of AI,

For context, I'll give some quick background info on me. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a non-technical degree a few years ago, and I built my first company while still a student there. I was able to bootstrap to \~$200k in profit, which I split with my co-founder. It was a services business, and I heavily leveraged cold outreach to get the number of customers we did (thank you Pitchbook!). When I graduated, I started working at a F500 financial services company as a data scientist. Fast forward to late 2023, and I was fed up with this job and wanted to dive into startups full-time. I put all of my stuff in storage and decided to live in cheaper countries around the world, to lower my burn rate.

I focused heavily on building my technical skills, but I was never able to build anything that got past $1,000 in profit. This was a very humbling experience for me and made me realize that I don't want to build alone.

Earlier this year, I moved back to San Francisco and started working on a new company with a friend from college. It's a fintech company that unfortunately requires upfront capital to get started. I set an agreement with my co-founder that he'd get to stay at his job until we got funding and in exchange I'd get a larger equity stake.

Fast forward to today, I've spoken with 50+ VCs who have all rejected us. Consumer fintech is very difficult to raise for now, especially when you need $2.5M off the bat. We've pivoted to a new AI idea in the space where I built my initial bootstrapped business, and we're seeing some small signs of traction. However, my co-founder is still at his job and unwilling to leave. I have around 13 months of personal runway left living in San Francisco until I'm dead broke. I'm not feeling super optimistic. If we were both full-time, I think it'd be better, but doing this basically alone is pretty horrible.

Any advice on next steps would be much appreciated. I'm thinking of applying for jobs, but I really want to build startups. I've known this for a long time, and I'd really hate to give up.

,startups,"Hi all,

A year ago, I partnered with someone on a startup. She brought the idea, and I built the app and website entirely myself. We agreed on a 50/50 split. Over the past year, I’ve created a much better version and put in significantly more time and effort. We’ve attracted interest from two major B2B prospects, which feels like great progress.

However, things have gone south recently. She hired a lawyer to incorporate the company and now says 50/50 isn’t fair. She wants to reduce my share to 25%, even though she admits I’ve contributed more and am responsible for the technical success so far.

There are other frustrations, too:

She’s unhappy with a few bugs and said that as CTO, I’m responsible for UX as well. I was expecting her to define how users interact with the product, but when I said I’d need to code less to focus on research and customer conversations, she said that’s not her problem.

My laptop broke yesterday, and I need $2K(or 5 for a new) for a replacement to keep developing. She said it’s my issue to solve, just like hosting and subscription costs, which I’ve been covering alone.


From my perspective, it feels unfair to continue this alone or even bring in a new CEO, though one person has already expressed interest in stepping into that role.

I’m okay cutting my losses if necessary. However, we have two product demos scheduled next week with potential new customers, and I feel like the trust is completely gone. I’m unsure what to do with the data and code if I leave.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently working on a case study of product hunt and I can really use the experience of all the builders here, I&amp;#39;m very sure everyone here would have used product hunt once.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past some time, product hunt has been experiencing a lot of hate, because of reasons like not getting featured even after being top product of the day, product hunt has killed the viral loop etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear your opinion on product hunt,  &lt;/p&gt;

I have an investor who want to invest in my startup based in the UK.   
We discussed 2x different involvement which will require 2x different contract: 1x for the investment and 1x for a advisor position.  
  
I would like to know what are the next steps regarding contracts and shares.

I believe for the investment, I need to :   
\- Make him sign a Shareholder application letter for new shares  
\- Set a board meeting to approve this (It's only me so it's easy)  
\- Send him the approval letter  
\- He send the money  
\- I fill and send a SH01 Form to companies house  
\- That's it

Is that correct?

For the advisory contract, I bellieve I need to :   
\- Create a contract with cliff/vesting as we discussed  
\- We both sign the document  
\- Once shares vest, issue shares by fillling a SH01 to companies house.

I haven&amp;#39;t subscribed to it because I wanted to know what experiences others are having with similar services and their pricing. I appreciate any helpful input on this.Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Building with urgency is probably one of the most underrated skills a founder can master.

Over the years, I’ve seen too many founders lose focus because they lost their sense of urgency, but I also figured out how some founders regained and even doubled down on their focus by following some simple habits that anyone can use.

But first, let’s get one thing straight:

If you’re building something especially in the SaaS space, the idea that “great things take time”, can be safely thrown out the window - time is a luxury we don’t have anymore. 

But why?

AI has changed the landscape and it’s now easier to build software companies than ever before.

But that’s not all…

Every idea has 10+ VC-backed and bootstrapped competitors out there.

Speed and momentum become everything.

That’s why building with a sense of urgency is a HUGE unlock; because it might be the single biggest thing that will separate you from everyone else.

But what are some ways to do it properly?

1. **Set clear deadlines** — these could be real or artificial, but you have to really stick to them. They have to be aggressive but realistic. It’s even better if you can justify the timelines to yourself and your team. Deadlines, especially with consequences create a strong urge to get things done.
2. **Have a mission/north star** — working towards something bigger than yourself becomes magnetic. While OKRs are great to have, having that purpose alongside timelines creates a potent combination of things to do!
3. **Be accountable** — this becomes really important when you’re either a small team or a solopreneur. It’s a double-edged sword because you’re not beholden to anyone except yourself and the business. This means you can take as much time as you want on a project and not be at risk of being fired. But if you find that you still can’t be accountable to yourself, then be accountable to your investors and/or your customers that believe in you. Ironically, accountability towards others is more powerful than towards yourself.
4. **Simplify your roadmap** — focus on what really matters to move the needle for your biz. Remove all the nice-to-haves and just get the essentials out to the world - remember, done is way better than perfect.
5. **Iterate** — keep testing and updating the product. But the real key here is that the act of iterating becomes a fly-wheel. As you gather more feedback, you’ll be motivated to correct, improve, and release new updates back to your customers. This is why it’s so important to get your product into the hands of as many people as possible - it generates that momentum.

The founders who do this well have this maniacal obsession about progress.

They want to see stuff get done, people taking action, and moving the needle as much as possible in the right direction.

What you realize is that when you do this enough times, the notion of urgency becomes the default for you and your team - it becomes deeply embedded in your culture.

Ultimately, build like your future depends on it.",t2_7pdrb526,False,,0,False,"Building with urgency, and why I think it matters",[],r/startups,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1gw49fe,False,light,0.29,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},I will not promote,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1732152338.0,text,6,,,text,self.startups,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to throw this one down because I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of questions from founders about losing their motivation and fire to build. &lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"Hey everyone,

I’m a digital nomad currently based in the U.S., but I travel a lot and love the freedom this lifestyle brings. Right now, I’m in the process of building my own startup, and I’ve been deeply inspired by Pieter Levels’ journey.

For those who may not know, Pieter Levels is a well-known digital nomad who’s built multiple highly profitable businesses, including Nomad List, Remote OK, PhotoAi, and even a merchandise business. Beyond websites, he also generates income through YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and other streams. He’s an incredible example of how someone can bootstrap and scale multiple businesses while staying remote.

**Here’s what I’m curious about:**

1. **Business Structure:** Does anyone know how entrepreneurs like Pieter set up their business income streams? Are they typically routed through a single entity like an LLC, or are they managed as separate entities for each project? If everything is routed through the LLC, should the LLC elect s-corp status?
2. **Taxes for Nomads:** As someone living the nomadic lifestyle, how do you manage taxes when you’re earning from multiple sources across different jurisdictions? Do you consolidate everything under one tax structure or file separately for each income stream? Especially since I live across many states in the US, does that mean i have to file taxes at all these states? Also my websites operate worldwide, so how would taxes in general work? I heard Wyoming is a good place to set up the LLC because of the flexibility and zero state taxes it provides.

I’m trying to figure out the best way to structure my own business as I grow and diversify, and I’d love to hear your insights. If you’re juggling multiple ventures or have advice on simplifying operations while staying nomadic, I’d be super grateful for your input!

*Context* 

I stumbled upon a problem in the marketing and content asset management space. While there are some solutions that solve the problem in fragments, I was sure a holistic approach would work. I set out to build a product prototype in Bubble.io. 

I showed the idea and the WIP prototype to a few angel investors and they loved it. They’re willing to invest in getting this product out quickly and into the hands of customers. However, I’ve held them off saying I’d like to get the prototype in the hands of a few users and gauge their feedback. If there are viable signs of PMF, I’d love to take their investment and scale this rocket ship. 

I completed the prototype and I was my first customer. I LOVE my product and I genuinely believe this solves a ton of problems for me. 

I was invested in this build for nearly 3 months, so I decided to take a week’s break before I started putting this in the hands of my peers for user feedback. 

*The Problem* 

Now that I’m back from my break, I just can’t get myself to start handing it out. The cold feet stems from a simple fear: have I been drinking my own Kool Aid ? What if others don’t see the value the way I see it?

,startups,"I’ve been bootstrapping my startup for the past year, trying to retain as much equity as possible. Now that the MVP is nearly complete, I’m actively seeking a CTO. Recently, the idea of bringing on a fractional CTO came up as a way to avoid giving away too much equity.

However, as I’ve started reaching out to investors and VCs, they consistently emphasize the importance of having a CTO in place to raise capital.

Has anyone here had experience working with a fractional CTO? Were you able to successfully raise funds with this arrangement? How do investors and VCs generally perceive it? Are investors more open to fractional CTOs in early-stage startups, or do they generally see it as a red flag?

I’m drawn to the idea because it minimizes equity dilution, but I’m also aware of the need for full commitment to scale the project moving forward.

Now that the MVP is nearly complete, I’m actively seeking a CTO. Recently, the idea of bringing on a fractional CTO came up as a way to avoid giving away too much equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I’ve started reaching out to investors and VCs, they consistently emphasize the importance of having a CTO in place to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone here had experience working with a fractional CTO? Were you able to successfully raise funds with this arrangement? How do investors and VCs generally perceive it? Are investors more open to fractional CTOs in early-stage startups, or do they generally see it as a red flag?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m drawn to the idea because it minimizes equity dilution, but I’m also aware of the need for full commitment to scale the project moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

We currently have an iOS app we have been using for validating our service. Now we are moving into bigger pilots and we need to revamp it. I coded the app and backend, but my design skills already hit their limit. We are based in Munich and are asking ourselves, what is the best move going forward. The options are:

*  Get a full time designer - Hard to justify as we don't have enough tasks to keep the designer busy full time in the next 6 months. 
* Get a local freelancer - We tried these two times but were not very happy with the results
* Use Upwork - We are currently leaning into this one but have not heard success stories from this approach
* Get references for freelancers - While it makes sense, we are seeing that is not easy to hit the venn diagram in what we are looking for and good recommendations from peers - perhaps just need to keep asking around. 

Any story on how to turned your app into a delightful user experience?

I run an ATM software business, and it's clear that paper and cash are still king for many. This got me thinking about the potential for a document digitization service, especially with the rise of LLMs like ChatGPT.

Imagine a service that not only OCRs documents but also indexes, catalogs, and even understands the content using AI. 

My initial thoughts:

* **Target market:** SMEs, law firms, medical offices, government agencies, and universities in Western to Central Europe.
* **Key selling points:** GDPR compliance, fast turnaround times, and advanced AI-powered indexing and search.

Questions for those with experience in document digitization (especially in Europe):

1. What's the biggest challenge you've faced in this business?
2. How do you price your services (per page, batch, subscription, etc.)?
3. Besides GDPR, what other EU regulations are critical?
4. What essential equipment/software do I need to get started?
5. How do you ensure document security and confidentiality?

I’m looking for recommendations for software that can help create dynamic, professional-quality app demo videos. 

The idea is to highlight the features and user interface of the app in an engaging way. 

Specifically, I need a tool that can record the app screen and automatically add zoom effects, pan across the screen, and focus on interactions like taps, swipes, and clicks.

You might know that style from SaaS product demos, where the video zooms in on key actions, follows the cursor or touch interactions, and gives a polished feel to the walkthrough.


I literally only know the ones that work for desktop but recently saw something like that on this sub(sadly OP didn‘t answer)

,startups,"Please, please, please... make sure you understand the potential value of your equity, whether you're currently employed at a startup or evaluating an offer letter. Here's a quick way to estimate your equity:

1. **Estimate acquisition price (ARR x exit multiples)**
   * Look up industry multiples. For B2B SaaS companies, typical exit multiples might be:
      * Low end: 5× ARR
      * Average: 10× ARR
      * Good: 15× ARR
      * Best-in-class: 20–25× ARR (often through strategic acquisitions)
2. **Make an acquisition fee assumption**
   * Assume 10% in fees. This covers costs like investment banking, due diligence, legal, and consulting fees. So, 10% will come off the top of the acquisition price
3. **Look up equity capital raised**
   * Equity capital raised is typically preferred equity, which gets paid back at sale to preferred shareholders (investors) before common shareholders see proceeds. This can be typically found online on Crunchbase or by adding up all the funding rounds
4. **Determine your equity ownership**
   * Divide your shares by the total fully diluted shares outstanding. Note: You likely do not have direct access to the cap table, but it is appropriate to ask for the # of shares outstanding when receiving an offer. If your a current employee, ask someone with access.
5. **Calculate your cost to exercise**
   * Multiply your shares by your strike price(s). This is what you'll pay to exercise your stock options. Note: I wont be discussing this in the post, but be mindful of AMT tax implications on the delta between the FMV and strike
6. **Determine net gain or loss on equity**
   * Equity value = (((Acquisition Price × (1 - Acquisition Fee %)) - Capital Raised) × Your Ownership %) - Cost to Exercise

**Let's take a look at an example for B2B SaaS**

Details

* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $20 million
* Potential Exit Multiples: 5×, 10×, and 15× ARR
* Acquisition Fees: 10% of acquisition price
* Capital Raised: $80 million
* Total Shares Outstanding (Fully Diluted): 40 million shares
* Your Shares: 175,000 shares
* Your Ownership Percentage: 175,000 / 40,000,000 =0 .4375%
* Strike Price per Share: $1.25
* Cost to Exercise: 175,000 shares × $1.25 = $218,750

Calculation (for 10x multiple estimate)

* Company purchase price: $20m \* 10m
* Proceeds after fees: $200m × (1−0.10) = $180m
* Proceeds after paying back investors: $180m −$80m = $100m
* Value of your equity: $100m × 0.4375% = $437.5k
* Net gain/loss on equity (adjusted for exercise cost) = $437.5k − $218.75k = $218.75k

Net gain or loss on equity

|100m (5x ARR)|200m (10x ARR)|300m (15x ARR)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\-$175k|$218.75k|$612.5k|

Yes, you read that right, the employee actually lost money at the $100m exit, due to the capital raised and the cost to exercise exceeding your share of the proceeds.

Hi everyone,

I have a couple of ideas that I'm passionate about and have just signed up for an accelerator program. I'm currently in the ""Learning the Fundamentals of Startups"" phase and need to submit my idea next month. I'm looking for advice on which direction to take.

Here are my ideas:

1. **Idea #1**: This is in my industry but I'm less passionate about it.
2. **Idea #2**: This is indirectly related to my industry, and I have a 50/50 level of passion for it.
3. **Idea #3**: This idea is outside my industry and I have no prior experience with it, but I can't stop thinking about it.

I currently have no prototypes or MVPs, and I don’t yet have a tech partner or CTO. 

What do you recommend I focus on?

,startups,"Hey everyone, I’m 28, originally from India, and currently living in the US on a work visa. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering/Robotics (both undergrad and grad school), and I taught myself coding. I’m currently working in the Bay Area at a cutting-edge company in computer vision research, although I’m just starting to dive deeper into it.

I’m looking for advice on a few things as I plan for the future:

**1. How did people in similar situations make the jump into doing a startup?**  
I know I have the potential to start a company, and I really want to do it eventually, but I feel I need to work on myself a bit more before jumping in. The problem is, I don't have a strong financial situation (though I’m building it now). My family has only been debt-free for the last few years, and I was able to secure funding during my master's. That said, I want to make sure I’m ready both technically and financially. For those of you who’ve made the leap into starting a business from a tech career, how did you make that transition? How did you deal with the financial challenges?

**2. How do startup founders balance having a deep technical understanding, market awareness, and competition insight?**  
One of the challenges I’m facing is how startup people have a solid understanding of the technical side of things *and* the market, competition, and business strategy. I want to be able to have the technical knowledge to build something meaningful, but I also need to understand the larger context. How do founders typically get a good understanding of both?

**3. How do you keep up with trends in the ML field?**  
This one is specific to my current focus: Machine Learning, especially in the realm of computer vision and reasoning. I’ve been struggling to keep up with the trends in the field and feel like my understanding of core concepts is still lacking. I know I need to improve my discipline and push myself to learn more, but it’s a steep curve. How do you guys keep up with fast-evolving technologies, particularly in ML? Do you have any resources, routines, or strategies that have helped you self-improve?

**4. How can I leverage my current job at a good company for future goals?**  
I’m working in a cutting-edge company for computer vision research right now, though I don’t work directly on the computer vision aspect yet. I’m still just getting started. How can I leverage my position in a high-tech company to build my knowledge, grow my network, and prepare for a future startup? What’s the best way to use this environment to my advantage while still focusing on building my own business?

**Summary**:

* I want to start a company in the future, but I’m still building up my technical skills and financial situation.
* I’m currently working in computer vision/ML, but I want to deepen my understanding and stay on top of trends.
* I struggle with self-discipline and staying focused when working alone, but I know that’s what’s necessary for a startup.

,startups,"Hi there.   
  
I'm setting up a monthly subscription service (selling services) where most of my clients would be in the U.S. For this, I thought about using Stripe, as it's well-known and inspires a lot of trust among Americans, but they don't operate in Argentina (Where I'm from and pay taxes from). You can set up an LLC and open a bank account in the U.S. to use Stripe that way, but I was advised that this could be complicated and costly (it ends up getting a good part of your earnings if you're not making a lot of money).

My question is: What do you think is the best way to go about this? Maybe setting up an LLC in the U.S. is a hassle, but it’s the most viable option. Perhaps setting up a company in Europe is easier/cheaper? Or maybe there's another service I can use directly, where I can skip the LLC/consultation and still achieve my goal of a monthly subscription in USD.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m setting up a monthly subscription service (selling services) where most of my clients would be in the U.S. For this, I thought about using Stripe, as it&amp;#39;s well-known and inspires a lot of trust among Americans, but they don&amp;#39;t operate in Argentina (Where I&amp;#39;m from and pay taxes from). You can set up an LLC and open a bank account in the U.S. to use Stripe that way, but I was advised that this could be complicated and costly (it ends up getting a good part of your earnings if you&amp;#39;re not making a lot of money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is: What do you think is the best way to go about this? Maybe setting up an LLC in the U.S. is a hassle, but it’s the most viable option. Perhaps setting up a company in Europe is easier/cheaper? Or maybe there&amp;#39;s another service I can use directly, where I can skip the LLC/consultation and still achieve my goal of a monthly subscription in USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some extra info: I&amp;#39;m from Argentina but I also have an Italian citizenship/passport. Maybe this is useful for setting up an LLC in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas or experiences are welcome. Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"Hi everyone,

I’m in the early stages of developing a platform aimed at helping therapists share curated self-help resources (audiobooks and e-books) with their clients. The idea is to bridge the gap between accessible self-help tools and evidence-based recommendations, making it easier for clients to find trustworthy content and for therapists to enhance client engagement.

As part of my research, I’ve been trying to gather feedback from therapists through online communities like Reddit and Facebook groups. Unfortunately, I’ve faced significant pushback—some group admins were dismissive, and one response was even outright rude. I understand the need for group rules and boundaries, but as someone who’s new to this space, it’s disheartening and challenging to know how to navigate this.

I’m balancing this with running my private practice and managing ADHD, so it feels even harder to keep momentum with these initial roadblocks. I truly believe in this idea and want to create something meaningful that helps both therapists and clients, but I’m unsure how to move forward with getting the right feedback without being perceived as intrusive or self-promotional.

For those of you who’ve been through this stage, how did you handle getting early market research or feedback? Are there better ways to approach therapists or other professionals for input? Any advice or support would mean a lot right now.

,startups,"One of the biggest misconceptions that I’ve seen with founders on their pitches is around focusing on the problem vs. the solution.

Especially with the advent of GenAI, I started to notice that 8/10 pitches mentioned a lot more about the solution than the problem. 

I would hear from founders how AI would be used to do these cool things, but there was very little talk about how it was solving the actual problem in depth - it became a bad habit.

Side note: AI fatigue is real.

The best pitches I’ve seen are the ones that can strike a good balance between both, but they’re also the ones that have a higher probability of long-term success. 

Let’s talk about a few reasons why this is so important…

—

Solutions (i.e. the product) change at a faster rate than the problem - you’re building, testing, and iterating much more quickly. This is because of customer feedback and new insights along your product journey. It’s not unnatural to pivot multiple times.

The \*problem\* however is much more rigid, and less likely to change (but there are exceptions!)

Ideally, the natural path to take is to identify a core problem, and then find a solution around it. What you don’t want to do is the reverse. 

I’ve seen examples of founders trying to mold a problem to fit their solution. 

You can end up building something irrelevant consuming huge amounts of time, money, and resources into solving a particular problem that should have never existed. 

But how do you know when a problem needs fixing? 

That’s when it becomes unique to the founder. Those who are obsessed with the problem are usually the ones who can go the furthest. 

The problem needs to bother you A LOT. 

It’s when obsession takes over.

It needs to get under your skin and create discomfort for you to the point where you can’t get it off your mind. 

The great thing about this approach is that this type of relentlessness will take you down a rabbit hole you actually want to go down. 

If the problem matters to you enough, eventually you become fully immersed and relentless in understanding \*why\* the problem exists and matters to you.

It means that the best problems to solve are also the ones worth solving but hidden in plain sight.

The plus side is that those who stay problem-focused unlock insights that their competitors miss.

But problems that could be solved don’t exist in a vacuum - it needs a solution. 

So going back to the pitches:

As mentioned previously, the most memorable pitches are the ones that can do the balancing act between problem and solution, but they also tell a great story about the problem and why it needs addressing.

They then use the problem as a segue into their solution.

But in many cases, the solution itself can convey a ‘set-in-stone’ perspective of what the company is (or will be) doing. 

However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.

The solution presented in the deck could change a number of times. 

The reality is that it’s not about having THE solution, but it’s having A solution, especially at such an early stage.

Any thoughtful solution to a worthwhile problem is worth building. 

The goal is to get your initial solution in the hands of your ideal customer as quickly as possible and iterate from there.

It’s about finding what works and if the solution is truly addressing the problem you’re trying to solve.

You’re not going to get it right the first time, so it’s best to build early and deploy fast.

Over time, you’ll refine the solution and have a much better understanding of the problem. This will then feed back into the investment deck, and all the branding and marketing materials that come with it.

Ultimately, the companies and brands that have longevity are the ones who are completely locked into the problem they want to solve.

After working with several startups to bring their ideas to life, one thing has become clear: the process of building an MVP is never as straightforward as it seems. Every founder faces tough choices about what to prioritize, what to cut, and how to move fast without breaking everything.

Here are a few lessons I’ve learned along the way that might help others here:

1. Your MVP is not your final product. It’s a learning tool, designed to test assumptions and validate your idea. Treat it as an experiment, not a masterpiece.
2. Less is more. The fewer features you include, the faster you can launch and the clearer your feedback will be.
3. Time is everything. The longer you take to launch, the more you risk missing opportunities or burning resources.

,startups,"Hi everyone!

I’m in the process of validating a US travel-focused platform (non AI related), and I’d love to get your insights on estimating ad costs. The platform is a free website that combines elements of a blog, newsletter, and curated travel guides for things to do in specific locations. Right now, I’m focused on affiliate marketing to generate revenue, and my goal is to drive initial traffic to the site to test its viability.

I’ve researched CPC estimates for running ads via GPT, Claude, and a web search, and here’s what I’ve come up with for a starting point, but I'm not sure where I would land in these CPC's:

|**Platform**|**Low CPC**|**Average CPC**|**High CPC**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Facebook**|$0.30|$0.80|$2.00|Lower costs for broad targeting, higher for specific travel intent.|
|**Instagram**|$0.40|$1.20|$3.00|Higher engagement but generally more expensive than Facebook.|
|**YouTube**|$0.10|$0.30|$4.00|Video views can be cheap, but travel-related clicks can cost more.|
|**Pinterest**|$0.10|$0.70|$1.50|Great for travel inspiration with relatively low competition.|
|**Google Ads**|$0.50|$2.50|$5.00+|Travel is competitive, especially for popular destinations like Las Vegas.|
|**Twitter (X)**|$0.20|$0.80|$2.50|Less travel-focused but good for real-time promotions.|

Does this align with what others have experienced when running ads for travel-related content, Newsletters or affiliate-based platforms? Are there any platforms you’d suggest that might be under-utilized or offer lower CPCs for this niche?

Some context:

* We want to target induvial in or going to a specific undetermined US location.
* My budget is modest since I’m in the validation phase.

Also, if there are any tips for keeping costs low while driving targeted traffic, I’d love to hear them!

&lt;p&gt;➡️ PM 5: Minimal emotional polarisation, used to always approach problems with an open view, that greatly helped in managing stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;

First-timer college student here looking for your advice!

I got a job offer at a startup so far consisting of 7 people including the 3 founders, most of them are still college students or just graduated, they have one co-founder with a master's in business. 
They started almost a year ago and have a couple of clients already but no liquidity. It’s a B2B software business and they want to hire me as one of the leads for the development of a new product.
So far I have been working with them for a month now to see how it goes. During this time I offered my experience and advice in crucial DevOps decisions that they were very in need of and started outlining the new project.

Now it comes the time when we finally write  up a contract and here’s the deal: They can’t offer money as compensation (at least not from them) as they have no liquidity. (Nobody else at the company is getting paid atm and the founders are still investing in the company.)

Currently, I’m being offered a 0-hour contract with government financial support that you receive if you work in the Netherlands, two subscriptions that I need to work, an office space, a fancy title, and the “right of pre-emption for any funding rounds or distribution of equity”.

Since I’m risking enough by agreeing to something with no compensation I’d like to get something out of it if everything goes well.

So I would like to ask your advice on what kind of better equity options can I negotiate according to the circumstances.

I’m a startup founder with a growing business, but I have limited technical skills. We developed our website with freelancers but now we’re at the stage where we need to hire a full-time web developer with 2-3 years of experience to take our online platform to the next level. However, I’m struggling with how to conduct interviews effectively, given my lack of in-depth technical knowledge.

I want to ensure that I’m assessing their technical expertise as well as their ability to align with our business goals and company culture.

* What questions should I ask that go beyond surface-level knowledge?
* Are there any specific strategies, tools, or frameworks I could use to evaluate their skills? I know tools like HackerRank exist, but we have over 200 job applicants applying for the role and making them all do coding tests would inflate the interview budget far too much.
* Should I involve a third-party technical expert or consultant in the interview process? If yes, where do I find them and what kind of a budget am I looking at?
* How can I identify red flags during the interview process when I don’t fully understand the technical jargon?

,startups,"I am the co-founder of a ticketing platform (SaaS &amp; marketplace) based in Africa. My CTO and I started this journey in 2022, aiming to solve a major market problem in the events industry in Africa. Our vision was clear: create a platform that simplifies ticketing and access control while offering an accessible marketplace for event organizers and attendees. Initially, I approached him to hire him for system development, but he proposed we partner instead. Believing in his technical expertise and passion for the vision, I agreed, and we started the business with a shareholding structure of 65% (me) and 35% (CTO).

At the start, we shared a mutual enthusiasm for the project, but over time, our visions for the business began to diverge. These differences have gradually led to conflicts regarding the goals, target market, and overall approach to running the business. Our business development efforts and system development processes have become completely disintegrated. What’s more, I’ve found myself increasingly excluded from the technical side of things. Despite my repeated efforts to be kept in the loop about development progress, my CTO continues to operate in isolation, leaving me in the dark.

When we initially launched the partnership, we agreed to use the lean methodology. Our goal was to launch an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within 2022 to quickly gather user feedback and iterate based on market needs. However, we only managed to release a basic system for managing access control and generating hardcopy tickets—and this didn’t happen until 2023. I felt this was an unnecessary delay, as the initial scope of work was straightforward.

By early 2024, my CTO admitted that the workload was overwhelming, and we decided to hire additional help. We brought on board one developer and an intern, thinking this would ease the burden and accelerate progress. We set a three-month target to release V1 of the platform, with clear priorities and a defined scope. However, my CTO continued to add features outside the agreed scope, causing significant delays. As of today, we have yet to launch anything meaningful. In total, this means we’ve failed to launch a functional product since 2022—a reality that is increasingly disheartening for me as a co-founder.

To make matters worse, my CTO frequently takes on side gigs, often working with the same developer we hired to help with our project ( They are all on salary ). While I understand the need for financial stability in a bootstrapped startup, this directly impacts our progress and focus. Missing deadlines has become the norm, and the lack of accountability has led to lost opportunities. Some of our existing clients have even begun moving to competitors because our offerings remain limited. This is incredibly frustrating, as I’ve made multiple attempts to address the issue by discussing how the lack of communication and missed deadlines affect the business. Unfortunately, these discussions haven’t brought about any meaningful changes.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that we don’t have any formal agreements beyond the company incorporation documents. We never established detailed operational agreements or governance structures to guide decision-making or accountability. While this may have been fine in the beginning, it has now become a glaring issue as conflicts arise. Looking back, I take responsibility for not pushing harder to formalize regular meetings and progress reviews. Without these, it’s been difficult to align on priorities and address concerns effectively.

We are also operating from a rented flat, which serves as both our workplace and living space. This arrangement, paid for through company funds, initially seemed cost-effective but has contributed to blurring the lines between work and personal boundaries. It has also made it harder to separate professional disagreements from personal conflicts, further complicating the partnership.

For context, I’ve put everything into this business. From May 2022 until August 2024, I worked tirelessly—often 15-hour days without a single day off and without taking a salary. I only started drawing a salary in April 2024, but even then, I’ve kept it minimal to keep our expenses manageable. My motivation has always been the belief that we’re solving an important market problem, particularly in Africa’s events industry. However, as the time go by and progress remains stagnant, I’m starting to doubt whether we have the right team to execute this vision. I’m questioning whether it’s time to make some hard decisions for the sake of my own well-being and the future of the business.

Currently, I’m considering two options:

Option 1: Fire My CTO

One option is to terminate my CTO’s involvement in the business. While this might seem like the most straightforward solution, it’s not without significant risks. My CTO has been the technical lead from the start, and his removal would likely create a power vacuum and disrupt the already fragile development process. Given that we’re a small team, losing him would set us back significantly in terms of product development. Additionally, firing him could escalate tensions and lead to legal disputes, albeit with differing shareholding percentages.

On the other hand, his continued involvement is hindering progress. His lack of accountability and focus is directly impacting our ability to meet targets and grow the business. If I were to replace him, I would need to find a technical lead who not only understands our current development status but also aligns with the vision of the business. This would take time and resources—both of which are already stretched thin. The question remains: would firing him ultimately save the business or push us further into chaos?

Option 2: Let the Business Fail

The second option is to accept that we’re not the right team to execute this vision and allow the business to fail. This would involve letting the partnership dissolve naturally, either through mutual agreement or as a result of financial constraints. While this is not the outcome I want, it might be the most realistic one given the current circumstances. If the business were to collapse, I could take the lessons I’ve learned from this partnership and apply them to future projects. I’d also consider picking up the parts of the business that still have potential in the African market, such as the ticketing and access control systems.

However, letting the business fail comes with its own set of challenges. We’ve already invested significant time, effort, and resources into this project. Walking away now would feel like giving up on something that has the potential to succeed with the right execution. It would also mean leaving behind the clients and partners who have placed their trust in us. Moreover, there’s the emotional toll of watching something I’ve poured my heart into come to an end.

My Current Reflection

As I reflect on these two options, I can’t help but feel a sense of failure. I started this journey with so much enthusiasm and belief in the impact we could make. For the first two years, I was highly motivated, working long hours without compensation because I believed in the vision. But now, that motivation is waning as the reality of our disorganization and lack of alignment becomes more apparent.

I also recognize my own shortcomings in this situation. For instance, I should have pushed harder for formal agreements and regular meetings to ensure transparency and accountability. I also should have addressed the issue of side gigs earlier, as this has clearly impacted our ability to meet targets. While it’s easy to place blame on my CTO, I know that I share responsibility for some of the challenges we’re facing.

At this point, I’m seeking advice from those who have faced similar situations. What would you do in my position? Is it worth salvaging this partnership and trying to realign our efforts, or is it time to cut my losses and move on? Are there other options I haven’t considered that could help us get back on track?

,startups,"Hey,

I was procrastinating a little bit, looking at random posts on reddit and articles on google and I came across this thing on a website called Founder Reports. Now I don't get shocked easily because I know that we have a mental health crisis going on that no one really talks about but 87,7% is just too much IMO. 

I wonder why isn't anyone talking about this? And if they are it's not enough. Imagine you sat 10 people in a room and 9 of them had a mental health problem going on. That would be quite concerning. 

The thing with us entrepreneurs is, we don't really care about anything else but success, whatever it may be. And we are willing to risk it all, even at the expense of our mental health. But what happens if you don't make it and it gets worse I ask myself? What then? Do we just ""thug"" it out? Do we tell someone? Oh, but what if they don't understand us? It's normal for entrepreneurs to try and figure things out by themselves but what If they can't? What then? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for all of us or are some destined for misery their whole life? This is a really shocking statistic and a huge problem in our circle. I'm lucky and have friends who are also entrepreneurs and we can talk about our struggles (business and mental), but many people don't.

I think the bigger issue is that we’ve normalized suffering as part of the entrepreneurial journey. ""Hustle culture"" tells us to work harder, sleep less, and figure it all out on our own. But at what cost? If 87.7% of us are struggling with mental health issues, then clearly, something is broken. We’re told to be resilient, but resilience shouldn’t mean ignoring our well-being...

What’s worse is that many of us don’t have a support system in place. Like I said, some entrepreneurs are lucky enough to have friends who get it, but what about the ones who don’t? Who do they talk to when the stress becomes unbearable? And how do they even bring it up without feeling like they’re admitting failure?

I don’t have all the answers, but I think we need to talk about this more. We need safe spaces where founders can openly share their struggles without judgment. Maybe it’s an online community, a meetup, or even just a buddy system where you check in with someone who understands what you’re going through.

What do you guys think? Is there something that has helped you manage the mental toll of being an entrepreneur and running your own business? Or are you just pushing through, hoping it gets better? Let’s have an honest conversation about this because 87.7% is way too high, and we need to do better—not just for ourselves, but for the people who depend on us.",t2_skk2su4wg,False,,0,False,87.7% of entrepreneurs struggle with at least one mental health issue,[],r/startups,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1gtytu9,False,light,0.42,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},I will not promote,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1731912214.0,text,6,,,text,self.startups,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was procrastinating a little bit, looking at random posts on reddit and articles on google and I came across this thing on a website called Founder Reports. Now I don&amp;#39;t get shocked easily because I know that we have a mental health crisis going on that no one really talks about but 87,7% is just too much IMO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder why isn&amp;#39;t anyone talking about this? And if they are it&amp;#39;s not enough. Imagine you sat 10 people in a room and 9 of them had a mental health problem going on. That would be quite concerning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing with us entrepreneurs is, we don&amp;#39;t really care about anything else but success, whatever it may be. And we are willing to risk it all, even at the expense of our mental health. But what happens if you don&amp;#39;t make it and it gets worse I ask myself? What then? Do we just &amp;quot;thug&amp;quot; it out? Do we tell someone? Oh, but what if they don&amp;#39;t understand us? It&amp;#39;s normal for entrepreneurs to try and figure things out by themselves but what If they can&amp;#39;t? What then? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for all of us or are some destined for misery their whole life? This is a really shocking statistic and a huge problem in our circle. I&amp;#39;m lucky and have friends who are also entrepreneurs and we can talk about our struggles (business and mental), but many people don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the bigger issue is that we’ve normalized suffering as part of the entrepreneurial journey. &amp;quot;Hustle culture&amp;quot; tells us to work harder, sleep less, and figure it all out on our own. But at what cost? If 87.7% of us are struggling with mental health issues, then clearly, something is broken. We’re told to be resilient, but resilience shouldn’t mean ignoring our well-being...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that many of us don’t have a support system in place. Like I said, some entrepreneurs are lucky enough to have friends who get it, but what about the ones who don’t? Who do they talk to when the stress becomes unbearable? And how do they even bring it up without feeling like they’re admitting failure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have all the answers, but I think we need to talk about this more. We need safe spaces where founders can openly share their struggles without judgment. Maybe it’s an online community, a meetup, or even just a buddy system where you check in with someone who understands what you’re going through.&lt;/p&gt;

,startups,"Hi there everyone

My partner and I are developing an online tool to aid decision-making in a specific industry. The tool processes vast amounts of data from a massive database, presenting clear and concise insights. To our knowledge, there’s nothing like it currently available for that industry.

Here’s where we’re at:

* We’re building an MVP using a smaller, manually created dataset to test the approach and gather feedback from trusted industry contacts.
* I have a solid understanding of the industry and its need for such a tool, while my partner (a programmer) has brought my idea to life technically.
* The large database that could truly unlock the tool’s potential is owned by a large nonprofit organisation.

Our main concern is figuring out how to approach this organisation. Neither of us has experience negotiating data access agreements, and we worry they might see our idea and develop their own solution.

One alternative we’ve considered is starting with a similar, smaller organisation to test the tool with a live dataset and later approach the larger organisation with evidence of our tool's usefulness. However, this raises concerns:

1. The smaller market and less sophisticated user base may not fully benefit from the tool, limiting our proof of concept.
2. We risk someone else replicating the idea with the larger organisation while we focus on the smaller one, potentially losing our competitive edge.

I’d appreciate advice from anyone with experience negotiating data access agreements or navigating similar situations. What factors should we consider, and how can we protect our idea while forging partnerships?

Looking forward to your insights.

Cheers

,startups,"From Manufacturer to Startup CEO: Should I Raise Funds or Bootstrap? Seeking Guidance!

Hi everyone,

I’m a 33-year-old non-technical CEO of a tech startup in the textile industry. My journey began about 5-6 months ago when I built an MVP(3 months ago) on Bubble.io. Despite being a no-code platform, it helped me attract 80+ users within a 2km radius, and I’ve even seen some organic growth. Recently, I found a tech co-founder who’s now rebuilding the product with proper coding, as Bubble has its limitations for the features we need. Along the way, I also onboarded a CMO (a close friend) during my marketing efforts.

Here’s where I need advice:

Before starting this, I owned a textile manufacturing unit and made a decent living. But since diving into the startup, I’ve struggled to balance both worlds. Recently, I closed down the manufacturing business because the building owner rented the space to someone else. Now I’m all-in on the startup, but it’s not generating enough revenue to support me yet.

My family (especially my dad) wants me to return to manufacturing to make a living until the startup becomes viable. They’re hesitant about me investing personal funds (up to 50 lakhs INR) into the startup, even though I believe in its potential. On the other hand, I keep hearing advice to bootstrap for as long as possible and avoid diluting equity early on.

So, I’m at a crossroads:

1. Should I restart manufacturing on the side to stay afloat while slowly building the startup?

2. Should I try to convince my family and invest personal funds?

3. Or should I dilute equity and raise external funding now to fully focus on the startup?

I’d love to hear from fellow founders, especially those who’ve faced similar situations. How did you balance financial stability with chasing your startup dream?

E. Facility for customers to add to shopping cart. 

F. A scheduling tool so the customer can select a date and time from a calendar and clock to book their own appointments.

G. When going to the shopping cart, I want a customer to be prompted to associated products they might add to basket.

H. A chatbot powered by AI which eventually pings me an email when it cannot answer a customer query so I can call them to resolve.

,startups,"6 months ago I was just another lost high school senior with zero clue what to do next. It felt like there were two paths: either jumping on the entrepreneur path that was all over Instagram, or being the ""good kid"" heading to university.

I thought... screw it, why pick? Started working on a startup while doing uni.

First startup? Complete flop. But hey, failed fast and tried again. Second time was different - built an AI Web Design platform by myself and somehow managed to grow it to 8k users in just 3 months. Ended up selling it for $12k. Not life-changing money for most people here, but for an 18-year-old who had never seen more than a few hundred bucks? Mind-blowing.

That exit opened some crazy doors. Now I'm working at another startup that's like my old one on steroids in a team of 20 absolute killers.

Best part? All doors are open. Could start another company, keep learning from my current team, or jump to something new. Sky's the limit. (but for now I'm definitely staying where I am)

,startups,"Hi,

This might have been asked before but how do I get funding as a start-up? I have an idea that is yet untapped and has huge potential to blowup but it is utilizes a website and a phone app. I don't have any experience in building web applications so I have to hire developers to do that.

  
The thing is I don't need a lot of money to start, basically around 5k-7k CAD other than my own capital. How do I go about raising that capital? I am not looking for a loan, more so an investment where you give up a part of your company because I am not sure if I'll be able to return that money in case things go south.

  
Hope this makes sense and if anyone has any ideas on how to raise small amounts of capital, I'd really appreciate that.
