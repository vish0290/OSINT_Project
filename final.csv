After taking to many potential customers and market research I launched my website called PostPilot which may be you think another AI product or social media management tool but I think it is different and maybe I don't think there is any product like this in a  market which can fully automate content creation for your business.

PostPilot works in 3 simple steps:
1. Select template from wide range of templates available on our website (and trust me quality of template is best)
2. Describe your content preference 
3. Select timeing 

And all done now we will daily create and upload content on your account so you can focus on doing something great.

Maybe you think there is already tool like this in market some famous one are Buffer and SocialBee but PostPilot is different it's a fully automation tool from creating content to uploading on your account and I can assure it will be not like some typical AI generate content it will be good and genuine. 

We focus on small businesses and new start-ups whose main focus is to build business and save money on hiring big content creators so they can leave content creation to us.

It's not some promotion post but I just want to share something I created after grinding so hard (and little bit hoping to get customer üòÅ)

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c70,1h9347e,I Scaled Two E-Commerce Brands to $1M in Annual Revenue Simultaneously within 2 Years ‚Äî Here's My Story,"I wanted to share my journey of scaling *two* e-commerce brands to $1M in annual revenue at the same time within two years. It wasn‚Äôt easy, and I didn‚Äôt follow some ‚Äúperfect formula.‚Äù My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I‚Äôm not sharing this as an attempt to ‚Äúgain karma‚Äù or whatever and I‚Äôm not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here‚Äôs the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I‚Äôd ‚Äúmade it.‚Äù Spoiler: I hadn‚Äôt.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started‚Äîbroke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I‚Äôd ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. ‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn‚Äôt last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he‚Äôd quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in ‚ÄúPrint on Demand‚Äù platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn‚Äôt know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn‚Äôt about print on demand‚Äîit was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Make it higher quality.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she‚Äôs the skeptical type, but she was on board‚Äîwhich made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it‚Äôs not great, it won‚Äôt last.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn‚Äôt have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here‚Äôs the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you‚Äôre stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

‚ÄúThe difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it‚Äôs literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it‚Äôs a choice.‚Äù  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It‚Äôs up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I‚Äôve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it‚Äôs so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I‚Äôve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I‚Äôve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don‚Äôt deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I‚Äôm basically running it for free.

Hypothetical.... You're building out a services company that requires a lot of tech to operate at scale and meet margin objectives.   There are no complete off the shelf solutions because your IP is a very differentiated approach to the market.  There are however point solutions that can be PART of your platform.  

The company is B to B and B to C.  Think Healthcare with insurance companies and patients/clients.  
  
You narrow your platform choices down to either a Salesforce centric model, using their capabilities and app store integrated partners.  Or.  An Azure centric/DW centric model with integrated solutions and any custom work built using frameworks like React, etc..  You will be 'building' or 'configuring' a lot in either situation.

* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

We have been good friends for a while and always talked here and there about starting a company. I kind of stopped the ""talking"" and got to work and a week or two later told my friend that hey this is what I have been working on and we agreed to do it together.  I am CEO and he joined as CTO. 

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could! 

  
TLDR: 2 week hire wants to be CFO (they are good at what they do so far) what is the best way to judge if they are suitable and what would be a good compensation model for them given they are not a cofounder?

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c7d,1h8pt5k,Cold email works! here's my experience/recommended tools,"I‚Äôve been sending cold email outreach - both for sales of my PR agency and database and to contact journalists/creators on behalf of clients - for around 3 months now.

Stone cold. Zero prior relationship. At massive scale (with AI).

And I was skeptical. But guess what? It works.

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I‚Äôve learnt a ton so far that‚Äôs helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don‚Äôt rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

Google Workspace  
Apollo  
Coldsire  
Clay  
Instantly

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code)

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

Both co-founders are nice, and I've been with them for nearly 2 years now, with the last whole year unpaid due to changes internally, but we're planning on stepping on the gas again in the new year, and so I've put forward a proposal:

  
\- Define my role as a CMO (I cover the expectations for this role, but in the 2 years I've only felt like an undefined employee with zero stake in the business, so getting a defined role is important to me).

\- Award me 5% equity in the business (which they are both happy with).

  
They've agreed, but they said they'd want to give me 1% now (which I have upped to 2% because it's just a bit crap, plus the numbers don't add up), and another 1% every 2 months for 6 months to keep us all aligned and motivated. I can respect the thought behind it, but I don't have a motivation problem here, so it feels a bit off.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c95,1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace ‚Äî Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don‚Äôt**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash‚Äôs founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub‚Äôs early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **‚ÄúAha‚Äù Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb‚Äôs Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace‚Äôs reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors‚Äô successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don‚Äôt**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace‚Äôs liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c97,1h80z8i,Switching from Bubble io to an agency for equity,"Hey everyone,

Like everyone else, I was looking for a technical founder but couldn't find myself a match so I went for the no code development on my own and built a MVP with bubble io 

I launched it last year and now I have about 6k users with daily active users 600-700 and I'm looking at a pattern of growth. 6 months ago, I had about 470ish users but now they are growing fast.

Its an app in a certain niche so I don't expect it go much high but still the community is growing. 

Here's the issue which I am facing:

My costs are escalating for Bubble and my WUs have passed 1.5 million, and now I am close to getting billed in 1k on monthly basis. On top of that, I want to do something with the app which I can't do technically. 

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

I also received quotations from 5 agencies more and it was around 35-65k USD and on top of that a maintenance and support contract.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37c9a,1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I‚Äôd love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team‚Äôs mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team‚Äôs energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project‚Äôs progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can‚Äôt do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it‚Äôs important to recognize that. Admitting that you can‚Äôt do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it‚Äôs more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37ca2,1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this. I talked with a lawyer friend who said that charging fees is pretty normal, but usually for basic work like this it's a much smaller fee. So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for! It feels a little like a tactic to minimize share transfers by former employees - they're taking it just because they have gatekeeping access. 

I had a great experience with the company and I'm super friendly with the people there still - how would you handle this? Is this something you've seen before?

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37ca7,1h7k5e0,What I Wish I Did Sooner as a New Founder (Advice for You!),"**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôd do differently‚Ä¶**

**Document your journey.**

It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you‚Äôre working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here‚Äôs why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you‚Äôre deep in the grind, it‚Äôs easy to forget how far you‚Äôve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you‚Äôve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I‚Äôve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I‚Äôve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I‚Äôm bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I‚Äôve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It‚Äôs one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you‚Äôre just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you‚Äôre doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you‚Äôre not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I‚Äôve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

**Don‚Äôt wait. Start documenting today, even if it‚Äôs just for yourself, you‚Äôll thank yourself later.**",24,startups,1733433519.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7k5e0/what_i_wish_i_did_sooner_as_a_new_founder_advice/,experience

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cac,1h7eo7c,PLEASE consider also other pricing options than Subscriptions,"A full time business/start up coach here! I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

A close friend of mine recently lost his father, and it‚Äôs been devastating for their family. His dad was involved in the alco-bev industry for over 20 years, co-running a company with a few partners. He wasn‚Äôt the technical guy, and played a key role in sales and relationships.

After his passing, the other founders have been trying to push my friend out of the company. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see him struggle like this, especially since he now has the huge responsibility of providing for his family.

He‚Äôs trying to start his own business in the same field, focusing on importing Vatted Malt Spirit (VMS) from Scotland to India. The thing is, he doesn't know much about how this supply chain works or how to even get started. But he wants to continue in this field since his father accumulated a lot of good will in this industry and he kinda wants to continue his father's legacy.

If anyone has experience in the alco-bev industry, especially with Scottish distilleries or international supply chains, I would really appreciate your advice. My friend has lost so much already, and I just want to do everything I can to help him rebuild.

Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I‚Äôve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You‚Äôre Solving** It‚Äôs easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else‚Äîfundraising, branding, or scaling‚Äîcomes second to making sure you‚Äôre solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I‚Äôve been building this while working a 9‚Äì5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You‚Äôre More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you‚Äôll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It‚Äôs tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup‚Äîbranding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you‚Äôre not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it‚Äôs worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cbb,1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It‚Äôs been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here‚Äôs what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it.¬†

Bad: You‚Äôre critiquing humans, basically, so that‚Äôs tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends ‚ÄúI needed online dating help so I paid for it‚Äù? No customer retention because they‚Äôd get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site‚Äôs marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We‚Äôd review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out.¬†

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we‚Äôd have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it‚Äôs income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn‚Äôt make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I‚Äôm a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about.¬†

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect.¬†

It died because: I didn‚Äôt pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn‚Äôt know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don‚Äôt refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to ‚Äúbuild a better mouse trap.‚Äù

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools.¬†

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating.¬†

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself.¬†

Bad: User acquisition wasn‚Äôt easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn‚Äôt pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500.¬†

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property.¬†

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don‚Äôt assume a company‚Äôs internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn‚Äôt jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales.¬†

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted‚Ä¶

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like ‚ÄúVacord Industries, LLC.‚Äù and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just ‚ÄúVacord‚Äù so the emails can be more like ‚ÄúHey Jack, how‚Äôs your xyz at Vacord?‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúHey Jack, how‚Äôs xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?‚Äù

Good: People said they‚Äôd pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out.¬†

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:¬† There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again‚Ä¶

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It‚Äôs easier to market than anything else has been, and it‚Äôs got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really glad we found your tool‚Äù is huge to me.¬†

Bad: It‚Äôs a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it‚Äôs growing slowly. I‚Äôm starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don‚Äôt be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you‚Äôre wasting your time and money building something that won‚Äôt work in the market.

\----

This isn‚Äôt even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cbc,1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I‚Äôm a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers‚Äîjust a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we‚Äôd never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here‚Äôs what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki‚Äôs 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you‚Äôre a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it‚Äôs vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it‚Äôs a significant issue worth solving.

I‚Äôd follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I‚Äôd revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails‚Äîno friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* ‚ÄúThis investor will drill into your TAM‚Äîmake sure it‚Äôs airtight.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúAvoid using the term ‚ÄòAI agent‚Äô with these firms.‚Äù

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there‚Äôs one thing I wish someone had told me: Don‚Äôt raise money in the summer.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cbf,1h6iy9o,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions.¬†

‚ÄúLet the early adopters gamble,‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.‚Äù

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn‚Äôt ignore. These weren‚Äôt just dreamers ‚Äî they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened.¬†

And they all agreed on one thing:¬†

**AI isn‚Äôt a trend ‚Äî it‚Äôs the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ‚Äô90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about efficiency,‚Äù one founder told him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about survival. If you‚Äôre not using AI, you‚Äôre already behind.‚Äù

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy.¬†

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions**¬†driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI**¬†on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources**¬†for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the¬†company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn‚Äôt just about Headway. It‚Äôs about what AI can do for your business‚Äîif you start today.",2,startups,1733326668.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/,experience

We are building a tool to create automated product catalogs. Here‚Äôs how it will work-

You give us a google sheets link to your products which has the product name, image, description, price etc. 

You can either upload a png of your catalog background or we can import your designed template from canva.

We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.

We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.

Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.

You can download your catalog as a pdf

My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.

While catalog generation and updation is a bottleneck for them, they want it as a service. Where we create excel, create catalog template and generate catalogs for them.

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cc5,1h6cn1l,"36 startup ideas found by analyzing podcasts (problem, solution &amp; source episode)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains ‚Äì this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

67558db3eeb7770cf0a37cc6,1h6bvbz,"SaaS stuck at $8-10k MRR for a year now, how do we 10x this?","Hey everyone,

  
Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always). 

Our strongsuite vs competitors is SEO, which is where we're doing a lot better than some, but they seem to be getting more traffic, revenue (1 competitor hit $1m ARR in 6 months using YouTube &amp; Google ads only) which is pretty mind boggling to me. 

So we're planning to run YT, Google ads and an extensive competitor research stint, that'll help us replicate this. 

Any who was in a similar situation have any advice on this? 

Edit - if anyone has 10X'd their SaaS using ads (+ve ROAS) using YT, Meta Ads, feel free to reach out, if you can get us to $1m ARR, we'll give you 10% of our recurring revenue for 6 months.",17,startups,1733303019.0,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6bvbz/saas_stuck_at_810k_mrr_for_a_year_now_how_do_we/,question
67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cc7,1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing ‚Ç¨75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

I‚Äôve got some advice to share that‚Äôs been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? ‚ÄúDone is better than perfect.‚Äù Don‚Äôt get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100. Then, based on user feedback, you can decide whether to continue investing in improving the product or to pivot.

Another tip is to create a landing page as soon as possible to start engaging with your users. This helps you gather valuable insights and build a community around your product from the get-go.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cd1,1h5yefu,"Am I thinking correctly about how to develop an ideal client profile for a tool to help websites deal with bot traffic? 
","We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

Am I missing something here?

Am I thinking about it the right way?

What do you guys think?

* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don‚Äôt actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cd3,1h5y72m,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?","So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

Even though the upvotes were low at \~15, the amount of traffic was pretty decent spiking at 1,100 DAU which was amazing. This makes me think 2 things. Firstly, lots of people  were intrigued enough to try the app and didn't really like it so they didn't upvote.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cda,1h5oz6l,The Product-Market-Fit confirmation I could only dream about,"Hey there! I'm solo building my SaaS for more than 2 years now, selling for 13 months already. I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down.

So, maybe among you there are those who, like me, did not know which direction to go. Please advise me where to look, which startups are better to do?

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cdc,1h5l966,Do you create avatars for your marketing strategy?,"Creating an avatar means you imagine what your target audience is like and try to feel into them. This could look like:

* male, 30 years old
* plays golf
* reads the financial times
* is a lot on social media
* ...

I've often read and seen people using avatars for their marketing strategy. I undestand that bringing your target audience 'into live' is nice to get a better feeling of what they are like and ultimately how to get in touch with them. But from my understanding most of the characteristics is based on pure speculation and assumptions. Let's take my example with the 30 year old male. I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

I am pretty sure I miss something here, in this entire create an avatar concept.

Do you create an avatar for your marketing strategy? If yes, how does it help you exactly?

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37ce3,1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built?

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There‚Äôs no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We‚Äôre not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here‚Äôs the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we‚Äôve put into the company. Right now, he‚Äôs unable to pay more money because he‚Äôs fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states¬†**""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""**¬†which doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. I‚Äôm not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I‚Äôm a software engineer‚ÄîI can code fast and efficiently‚Äîbut this feels like uncharted territory.

I‚Äôm currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I‚Äôm not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I‚Äôm skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes,¬†**stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He‚Äôs also offered $500‚Äì$1000 a month, but I‚Äôd honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here‚Äôs my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea. Over the past 3 years, I have had multiple Venture Capital and Incubator internships, working at some pretty large VCs, one having $500M in AUM.

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

**How You Can Help**

What do you think of this idea? Does it sound like something you‚Äôd use or recommend to someone? Also, what features would you prioritize in a platform like this? Any feedback or suggestions would be incredibly helpful!

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cef,1h4uu0k,What marketing skills are required for joining early startups? ,"Hi :) 

  
I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment?

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cf0,1h4ta7r,Please advise ,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the early stages of building an MVP for my startup, and could really use some advice and encouragement from this amazing community.

A bit about my startup: My company is focused on revolutionizing agricultural trade and beyond. Our vision is to empower smallholder farmers by connecting them with global buyers through a blockchain-integrated web portal.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.
It's been a challenge balancing the development costs while maintaining the momentum of the project.

What I'm looking for:

Advice on getting investors after completing the MVP: For those of you who've been here before, how did you approach investors at this stage? What worked for you?

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or even connect further if you're interested in this space.",1,startups,1733140492.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4ta7r/please_advise/,question

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37cf3,1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *‚ÄúWhy not try making my own dream come true?‚Äù*. That‚Äôs when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn‚Äôt easy. I didn‚Äôt make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren‚Äôt being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lifesaver!‚Äù* That‚Äôs when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I‚Äôve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It‚Äôs been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I‚Äôve started working on another extension for Claude, which I‚Äôm hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration.

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting**¬†after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.**¬†Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37d00,1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

If you don‚Äôt meet those criteria, you‚Äôll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven‚Äôt already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

67558db8eeb7770cf0a37d19,1h3lod0,How do I get first users to sign up?,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d2b,1h24jxo,how I learned to sell as a founder (without feeling like a sleazy salesperson),"If you think sales are only for ‚Äúsalespeople,‚Äù you‚Äôre probably leaving money on the table. After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here‚Äôs the truth: sales isn‚Äôt about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I‚Äôve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50‚Äì100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer‚Äôs pain points.
4. **Don‚Äôt Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return‚Äîlike a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you‚Äôre not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you‚Äôre flying blind.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d2d,1h24935,I ruined the succesful person I had become. How to get back on the horse? ,"Hi everyone.

It's often said, that what matters most is not the things you build **but the person you become.** I have destroyed this person.

I will try to make this as short as possible.

**Story (skip if you want)**  
I'm failing my startup that I have worked on for 3 years now, full time. We made a MVP, got an investment, and over the few years 2 more investments. We were 4 cofounders. As all other startups we had some problems, but generally did a pretty decent job - But the last year things just went down down down.

6 month ago I could see where we were heading, so instead of driving 180 miles/hours off the cliff we acted. I was the person most suited for the job, so all got dismissed except me. I geared things down and ran the startup for 6-8 months alone, hoping to find a solution. It was hard. We were hoping for some light at the end Q4, and even though we reach much higher than previous years, it's not enough - We will die in a few months.

I have already gotten my previous job back that can sufficiently provide for my private financial situation (house, wife, kids) and ALSO give me time to work on another startup if I want to. I can give details if asked. My former coworkers are far ahead of me in this field now, and this is also hard to see, but I knew the risk.

**The problem:**  
The thing is. I WAS an incredible person. My strength as a person was my self discipline. I always did the right and uncomfortable thing. Ate right, worked out, spend every waking hour building, early mornings, and it paid off greatly. I build some incredible things. I peaked very early. Too early.

And the last few years has really taken a toll. Im exhausted. I have learned ALOT in the past few years, and I want to apply them on my new startup but i'm not getting anywhere, because my actions doesn't match my plans/words.

Let me give you one final piece of the puzzle. When I build my persona with incredible self discipline and skills, I read maybe 170 self discipline/help/business books. Now I can't find anything that inspires me, and because I have already read almost everything, i'm not getting excited and pumped by anything. I reread them alot, but they does nothing for me. Even ""No Excuses"" by Brian Tracy, that was my bread and butter is worthless for me.

Last note: I know when I write exhausted, every one will say: Take a break. But I dont know if I want that either. I want to make up for the lost years. I want back on the horse asap.

It's mentally and physically so hard to fail after you've given everything. Never the less, that's the risk.

**How do I get back on the horse when i'm not getting pumped by anything? My ""why"" is gone..**

**Update:**  
1st of all, i'm surprised by all the great answers. You are all awesome. It helps ALOT, and I feel blessed for all the insights.   
**What I'm doing now:** I'm taking a short break. But I've pretty certain that I will be digging myself a much bigger hole if I relax too long. So I will use the good days to move myself and my new ideas/business forward, and accept the bad days and relax.  As practical stuff i'm removing my phone for 30 days. I've learned som really toxic behaviors by checking emails constantly etc. I will also read even more (just started ""Switch"", recommended from this post). We've always said that we're a product of the 5 persons we most associate with, but in this same aspect I would rephrase this to: We are the product of the content we consume daily. And I have a few that has to go, if I want to move forward from this. It's important that I consume the right content now or else consume nothing. I'm restarting my gratitude journaling and joined fitness. This was previously a way for me to mentally refocus my brain and goals. And lastly: I will not push forward right now. From your advice i'm pretty certain I will feel it when I'm ""allowed"" to push again. I suspect it wont take very long. Thanks to everyone who helped. Lets do this.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d30,1h1yryk,Should I start a startup or take a break and focus on mental health,"Hey all - just looking for some advice. I was eng lead at a startup that shut down in September, and to be honest, it took quite a toll on my mental health over the past year. The CEO/CTO were convinced it was engineering execution that was the root cause. While we had some eng issues, the founders had fired all existing customers a year ago and we spent the last year going through a series of ill thought out pivots. Every Monday I would meet with the CEO/CTO and essentially get blamed for the startup not working, and that started to really affect me.  
  
I started ideating on startup ideas in June when the writing on the wall was clear since I had always wanted to do a startup, and it felt like a good next step. However, after the startup shut down, I realized what a toll on my self confidence it had taken. I started developing issues like anxiety, mild depression and burnout. I took a bit of a break over and I'm doing better on those fronts, but not 100% better. Trying to ideate on startup ideas right after also didn't help - feelings of being lost and unsure also really surfaced.  
  
I've been considering whether I should take a bit of a break from startup land and take a job and just focus on improving my mental health, rather than continuing to ideate. I suppose what's stopping me is doing a startup has been a dream of mine for a long time, and it feels a bit like giving up. I'm also wondering if feeling this way is just a normal part of the startup journey, and it's something I just need to deal with and get out the other side so to speak. Just wondering if anyone else has felt similarly and how they dealt with it.

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all feedback positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting**¬†after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.**¬†Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

I‚Äôve been working on a new platform idea that connects people who have creative app ideas with developers who can bring those ideas to life. The twist? It‚Äôs not just about funding‚Äîit‚Äôs about **collaboration, trust, and sharing success**.

  
I have completed the core functionality development.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

* **Got an idea?** Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve always wanted an app for something specific. You can post your idea on the platform, and developers can pick it up if they think it‚Äôs feasible (and worth doing). If the community likes your idea, they can even invest in it, giving the developer the funds they need to make it happen.
* **For developers:** Developers can see which ideas have the most interest or funding **before starting work**, so they don‚Äôt waste time building something nobody wants. Plus, they can get funding upfront to help with the development process.
* **Revenue sharing:** When the app is launched, people who invested early can share in the revenue it generates. This gives everyone an incentive to support great ideas and help them succeed.
* **Credit and trust:** One of the key features I‚Äôm working on is a **credit rating system** for developers. Their ‚Äúscore‚Äù is based on their track record‚Äîapps they‚Äôve completed, user satisfaction, and how well they‚Äôve met deadlines. Over time, as the platform grows, this credit system will expand to include investors and idea contributors, so trust becomes a key part of the ecosystem.

I‚Äôve already built the core of this platform, and a few developers are excited to join. They see it as a way to avoid the usual guesswork (or funding struggle) that comes with indie development.

Here‚Äôs where I need your input:

1. **Would you use a platform like this?** Maybe you have a cool idea you‚Äôd love to see made, or maybe you‚Äôd want to invest in apps you think could succeed.
2. **As a developer, does this sound like something you‚Äôd find helpful?** Would you be okay sharing revenue if it meant upfront funding and validation for your project?
3. **What would make this platform trustworthy?** (I know trust is a big deal when it comes to money and ideas.)

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any questions! I‚Äôm trying to make sure this solves real problems for both developers and users before I go all in.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d3e,1h1iei6,How I'm losing loads of money every single month,"Hi everyone,

This will be a longer read, but I genuinely believe you‚Äôll get a lesson or two out of it.

First off, I want to clarify that this post isn‚Äôt intended as an advertisement. If it does come off that way, I assure you that‚Äôs not my intention. We‚Äôre just trying to share our journey, insights, and some of the successes we've achieved so far. We‚Äôre actually not interested in taking on any additional clients right this second, which is why I‚Äôm not including our agency name or specific details about how to contact us.

Before I dive into the details, everything I‚Äôm about to share is based on actual results, client feedback, and hard-won experience. If you have questions or want more insight, feel free to reach out ‚Äî I‚Äôm more than happy to chat and share details that could help.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

We run a lead generation agency focused on management agencies within a pretty unique field (rhymes with Only Sans). The industry itself isn‚Äôt widely discussed (morality debates are common), but it‚Äôs incredibly active. We operate differently from most service providers because we prioritize long-term value and genuine results over quick wins. With backgrounds in high-ticket sales, cold outreach, and lead generation, we‚Äôve built systems that produce results few others in this space can offer.

**Operations and Services**

It‚Äôs been exactly a year since we launched, and in that time, we‚Äôve had the chance to work with some of the more established agencies in the industry. By networking at conferences, participating in Q&amp;A sessions, and building relationships with experts, we‚Äôve established a reputation as a reliable partner in this space.

Our approach is straightforward: we use Instagram to source, find, and connect with creators. By focusing exclusively on creators from first-world countries who already have a proven track record, we‚Äôre able to provide quality that typical marketplaces often don‚Äôt. Our goal is consistency and reliability; if a creator doesn‚Äôt work out, we provide a replacement to keep our clients covered. This has been key in helping us stand out in a crowded market.

Generally, our payment structure is designed to be flexible based on each client‚Äôs needs. We charge a base rate that scales with the number and type of creators the client requires, with custom packages available if they have specific niche or demographic preferences. This setup allows us to offer both straightforward solutions and tailored deals to meet diverse client needs while maintaining quality and reliability in the leads we deliver.

**Additional Services**

One thing we‚Äôve learned is that adding complementary services has strengthened our client relationships. For example, if a client‚Äôs Instagram profile isn‚Äôt up to scratch, we offer rebranding support, which around 90% of clients take us up on. This additional service keeps clients engaged and reinforces our reputation for going above and beyond.

**How We‚Äôre Different from Marketplaces**

Marketplaces are technically our competition, but we‚Äôve chosen a different approach. Most marketplaces rely on creators from lower-income countries, which often leads to issues around language barriers, commitment, and reliability. Once any initial guarantee ends, these creators may leave, creating a new set of challenges for agencies. Our focus is on creators who already speak fluent English, have a track record, and meet specific standards for quality and professionalism. Rather than signing on anyone, we make sure creators are a solid match for both our standards and the needs of our clients.

Interestingly, some marketplaces have approached us to partner, offering to sell our creators through their platforms in exchange for a commission. We decided against it, as it would dilute the exclusivity and reputation we‚Äôve built. Instead, we recently found a way to partner through a white-label model, which allows us to expand our reach without compromising our brand or standards.

**Growth and Challenges**

We‚Äôve built a community of over 800 agencies on Telegram in just a year, which has been invaluable for growth. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs only the two of us. My co-founder and I handle every single part of the operation ‚Äî from marketing to client communications, sourcing leads, and fulfilling orders. It‚Äôs a heavy load, and while we‚Äôre no strangers to hard work, we know our time could be better spent if we had more systems in place. Right now, we‚Äôre turning away clients because we simply don‚Äôt have enough hours in the day.

Despite this, we‚Äôve managed to generate over six figures in our first year, and we‚Äôre proud of it. However, we know we‚Äôre missing out on even more substantial growth ‚Äî potentially an additional $50k/month ‚Äî simply because we‚Äôre operating at maximum capacity.

**Our Scaling Goals**

The field we‚Äôre in isn‚Äôt easy, and it‚Äôs filled with companies that don‚Äôt always operate with the best practices. Our commitment to honest, reliable service has allowed us to build a strong client base. That said, we‚Äôre currently facing some financial challenges, partially due to the mistake of mixing personal and business finances early on. Not to mention, we‚Äôre handling everything from A to Z (client communication, lead sourcing/closing, marketing, etc.), which is extremely time-consuming. With capital, we‚Äôd be able to delegate most of the tasks, and the two of us could start prioritizing actual growth. This is why we‚Äôre seriously considering funding, to help us stabilize and make strategic moves for long-term growth.

We have a solid scaling plan that could allow us to reach $50k/month in revenue at minimum, mostly by expanding our Instagram outreach (running multiple accounts, each representing a creator). But we‚Äôd need support to set up the necessary systems to automate and scale efficiently.

**What We‚Äôre Looking For**

We‚Äôre at a point where we‚Äôre considering funding options to help us level up. Has anyone here been in a similar position? If you‚Äôve navigated scaling a small team or managed exponential growth in a service-based startup, we‚Äôd love to hear about your experience. We‚Äôre even open to discussing equity if it makes sense for the right partner.

Any insights from fellow founders would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to discuss or share advice!",0,startups,1732750876.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h1iei6/how_im_losing_loads_of_money_every_single_month/,experience

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d47,1h17qy0,Virtual Business Operations - Please Destroy Idea if Stupid,"I am debating launching a company that helps small businesses navigate operations because it appears most suck at this unless they have one key employee who cares about efficiency and getting the work done.

I want it to be affordable - around $299 per month; something most companies would just subscribe to because there are no long term contracts.

I‚Äôve found that startups don‚Äôt want to hire someone for this role because it's something the CEO typically takes on themselves.¬†

Small businesses, however, need this role, but they have trouble filling it; they too fall into the category of not having enough resources to allocate for an Operations position.¬†

This ends with small businesses running inefficient ops ‚Äì ones riddled with ‚Äúhurry‚Äù and ‚Äúflying by the seat of their pants.‚Äù

Business owners don‚Äôt link operations and growth together either because they got to where they are today without having to.

Them leaning on a ‚Äúthis is the way we have always done things‚Äù mentality also stunts opportunity.

Businesses are not focused on the right things‚Äìlike growth and the what the future may look like‚Äìbecause they are too occupied with day-today operations that are inefficient.

They are also leaving money on the table by ignoring quality (having to do work twice) and they posses a ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù mindset instead of a ‚Äúproactive‚Äù one.¬†

All three of these (and there are plenty of others) lead to burnout and stress.

I am brainstorming a two-fold solution.

First, there are plenty of workers out there with the same mindset of continuously getting work done faster and better out there, they just aren‚Äôt connected with small businesses.

Companies simply don‚Äôt know how and where to find them unless they fall into their lap or walk into the door (like my personal situation).¬†

If a small business had access to this talent at a low price, would they be at least interested in trying it out for one or two months?

I would want to connect this talent, as I believe it could at minimum expose a company to its various inefficiencies.¬†

Secondly, since hiring people is expensive and time consuming, would a streamlined approach to operations that equips business leaders with the tools they need to improve operations be impactful? Is it even important?

I would like to provide a product/service (not just training) that integrates an Operations mind into a company's day-to-day and long term goals.¬†

The way I see this now is a remote team that assists on a weekly basis by providing groundwork and a road map. Of course, I could be totally wrong.",3,startups,1732723514.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h17qy0/virtual_business_operations_please_destroy_idea/,experience

The current CEO started this company back in June without building anything till January. Then the previous cofounder left because they were not able to raise or build the product. 

Then in March I joined as the CTO with equal equity as the current CEO, and built the compete platform. 

The problem I am having is except for the vision, the CEO does not do anything. He does not want to write code or cannot do it. Is not creating any sales pipeline or marketing campaigns, just waiting for us to finish the product before he does any of those things. He is hoping that we sign up the enterprise customer and then we will do all of those things. 

We are a bootstrapped business where he is funding the infrastructure costs, but to me that feels like a failure on our end that we are not able to get any investment so that we can cover our expenses. 

And with all of this, he just wants to maintain authority over the business, he wants to take all important meetings alone, all public facing discussions he wants to do, without taking any action that can help the business.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d53,1h0xnqw,Can my 10 year old company get VC funding?,"Hello! This is my first post so please go easy on me. 

I run a home service business that does $1.5m in revenue. We have been in business for 10 years as of last month. 

Over the years there have been MANY ups and downs, including nearly going out of business multiple times. Luckily, we have stabilized and now have a very healthy business. 

We have always had visions of being a national company but in our specific industry there seems to be an array of obstacles that make it nearly impossible to scale(we have tried many times). The only companies that do, do so by selling franchises. Franchises that turnover very often, due to franchisee burn out. 

As a tech person, I figured there had to be a better way using technology. 

So in the past 3 years I have been developing software that will mitigate the obstacles, giving a clear path to scalability. 

The software is essentially an OS/platform for our entire company to operate on. It makes everything more efficient and is designed specifically around our business operations. Instead of turning it into a SAAS I want to use it to scale and become the market leader in our industry. 

My question is simple: is this something a VC would be interested in? Or do they typically not invest in older companies?

We have: Live MVP, Team, Traction, Proven Business Model, Clear path to scalability 

You may ask why I need funding. 

Here is my answer:
I have bootstrapped for 10 years and have done everything in my power to keep this thing alive. We are currently profitable but in order to build this thing correctly I need to hire better talent and if I try to push for more revenue it gets harder to manage the software development. I need money to give me some breathing room.

I‚Äôm currently working on my pre-seed pitch deck and am grappling with whether or not to include TAM, SAM, and SOM estimates. While I understand these are often considered essential in investor decks, I‚Äôd love to better understand their relevance, especially at this early stage.

Here are some specific questions I‚Äôm struggling with:

1. Why are TAM, SAM, and SOM numbers necessary for a pre-seed pitch?
   * Are investors primarily looking at these to gauge ambition, feasibility, or something else?
2. Are there viable alternatives?a.

   * How can I ensure these numbers hold up to scrutiny without overpromising?

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d5d,1h0o1es,How I went from thinking I can never make online money to making my first ever 4 figures online.,"I wanted to share my journey, especially with those of you working on your side projects and feeling stuck.

Before I started my¬†web design agency¬†as a side project, I failed at seven different business ideas.

Each failure was tough, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt think about giving up. But those failures turned out to be the best foundation for what I‚Äôm doing now. Here‚Äôs why:

**1. Every Failure Taught Me Something Valuable**  
Each of those seven businesses forced me to learn a new skill:

* A failed dropshipping store taught me the basics of copywriting.
* A print-on-demand project helped me understand customer research.
* Freelance gigs that flopped showed me how to manage budgets better.

When I launched my web design agency, all those skills came together and gave me a head start.

**2. I Learned to Focus on the Long Game**  
At first, I was chasing quick wins, jumping from idea to idea because I thought the next one would be ‚Äúit.‚Äù Failing so many times forced me to slow down and focus on building something sustainable, even if it took longer.

**3. I Became Resilient**  
Let‚Äôs be real, rejection sucks. And after being ghosted by leads, hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù over and over, and seeing months of work fail, it‚Äôs easy to want to quit. But failing taught me that rejection isn‚Äôt the end, it‚Äôs feedback to improve.

**4. I Realized It‚Äôs Okay to Fail Forward**  
One of my biggest failures was getting scammed out of $2.5k in a remote opportunity. That loss left me terrified of trying anything online again. But I eventually realized that failure wasn‚Äôt a dead end‚Äîit was a lesson to trust myself and do my due diligence better.

**5. I Finally Hit My Breakthrough**  
Fast forward to my current side hustle: a web design agency.

For the first 8 months, I struggled to get clients. I worked on everything:

* Creating an irresistible offer
* Improving my outreach process
* Practicing my design skills

Nothing clicked. Until one day, in the 9th month, it all came together.

I closed 3 deals in 6 days, making my first 4 figures online. That wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the skills and resilience I built from those earlier failures.

If you‚Äôre stuck on your side project or feeling like it‚Äôs not going anywhere, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

* Every failure is feedback. use it.
* Build skills that transfer, even if this project doesn‚Äôt work out.
* Focus on why you‚Äôre building your project, not just the outcome.

Most importantly: Don‚Äôt quit. You‚Äôre probably closer to your breakthrough than you realize.

Anyone else here find that past failures helped them get where they are now? I‚Äôd love to hear your stories.",57,startups,1732658246.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h0o1es/how_i_went_from_thinking_i_can_never_make_online/,experience

I‚Äôm seeking some advice on a challenge we‚Äôre facing with our software platform. It‚Äôs a B2B2C solution that I currently sell in my home country, and from time to time, we get interest from users in other countries who really like it and propose ideas for expanding abroad.

Recently, we were approached by someone from the US who‚Äôs genuinely enthusiastic and wants to help sell our solution there. We‚Äôve agreed on terms, and while it‚Äôs exciting, we‚Äôre facing a specific challenge: currency support.

Our platform currently only supports euros, and building multicurrency functionality would require significant development work. However, our team is very small right now‚Äîwe‚Äôve had to scale back due to layoffs while extending our runway to close the next funding round.

Given these constraints, we‚Äôre considering a shortcut: creating a separate instance of the platform just for the US. This would simplify the process for now and allow us to test the waters without major investments in development.

That said, this trial comes with risks. For one, we‚Äôre not even sure if the guy will manage to sell anything. On top of that, I‚Äôm struggling to decide whether we should:
	1.	Use a different product name or domain for the US version to avoid confusion.
	2.	Stick with the same name and branding, but risk scenarios where European customers might stumble upon the US site and create unnecessary headaches (e.g., trying to log in or place orders on the wrong version).

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d5f,1h0nro8,From Comic Localization to ? - Seeking advice on expanding our tech,"Hey r/startups!

I wanted to share something that might spark some interesting discussion! We've built a tool that completely automates text extraction, translation, and seamless repositioning for images - and we've managed to cut localization costs and time by 80% for comic publishers. We have a strong background in computer vision, so this was within our expertise.

Our current focus has been comic publishing where manual translation was a massive pain point. We've proven the tech works, reduced operational friction, and are on the cusp of generating solid revenue. But here's where I'm looking for your collective wisdom: **Where else could this technology make a meaningful impact?**

Some initial thoughts I've had:

* Manga and graphic novel publishers
* Educational textbooks with complex diagrams
* Technical manuals with embedded text
* Packaging for international product markets

But I'm certain there are verticals I'm not seeing. Our current core tech is basically:

1. Intelligent text extraction from complex image layouts
2. Contextual translation with very high quality
3. Pixel-perfect text replacement
4. User can edit the result and our tool will reposition the updated text perfectly

Would love to hear from founders who:

* Have experience scaling niche tech solutions
* See potential use cases I might be overlooking
* Have navigated similar pivot/expansion challenges

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d63,1h0jfmd,Slicing Pie is the answer,"At least once a week there's a question here asking about equity split between founders.  The only fair answer is Slicing Pie (google it because the first time I posted this, mods took it down)

I say this as someone who:

1. Had to buy out my co-founder at my first startup and
2. Who is now using Slicing Pie

I won't dive into the details of Slicing Pie (unless anyone has any questions) but I'll tell you why its the only way I'll do things.

I started my first startup with a guy who was an excellent developer. We're both really good techies but he had much more skill than I did and helped bring a lot of ideas to the product.  However, he ended up losing interest after we launched the product because he somehow believed that the money would just start flowing on its own.   When that didn't happen he became less and less involved until he ultimately abandoned the company altogether.

The story has a happy ending, because I bought him out and moved on, but it was a super huge pain in the ass and overly contentious in ways it didn't need to be.  It could have gone much worse, however, because ownership was set at 60/40 and he could have held on until the end and caused all sorts of headache.

This is where the right application of Slicing Pie would have allowed for everything to go much more smoothly.

First, the entire premise behind Slicing Pie is that your ownership is based on what you contribute.  Depending on how you set it up, contributions can be in the form of time, expenses, or some other value provided.  To keep it simple: if you work 1000 hours and your co-founder works 500 hours, then you have 2x the equity.

In some situations, someone might say ""but my hour is worth more"".  Sure, if your anticipated salary is more expensive, then you can set it up so your hours count for more money.

Others might say ""well, my \*value\* provided to the company is more"" (for instance, sales vs. code).  That's fine, too. For us, we have things set up so there's a deferred commission scheme. With a commission of 5%, the person who gets the sale can put all of that cash back into the company, but consider that amount to be part of the overall fund.

The best part of Slicing Pie is that if you don't contribute, you don't get squat and if you do contribute, you get the value you give.

The 2nd best part is if someone decides they're not interested anymore, or they're unable to keep the prior pace, or something else happens, their stake in the company is continually diminished.

On this latter point, i don't recommend just saying you're using Slicing Pie. You need to form your initial agreements around it.  There's a bunch of resources and sample agreements on the Slicing Pie website.   What we did at my latest company is base the entire Operating Agreement around one of the agreements on that page.  We then went over it with our lawyer to customize things for us and to make sure everything was in compliance with the state we're formed in.

Two of the more important parts in our Operating Agreement are that we have the ability to remove someone who has abandoned the company and we can drag them along on investment, or M&amp;A.  In the case of abandonment, they can then also be bought out for FMV of their contribution. In the case of a drag along, that's just a standard drag along.

All in all I can't think of a more fair way of determining equity and avoiding conflict.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d66,1h0i121,8 Months as 1st Employee at Pre-PMF Startup ‚Äì Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been struggling in my current role and could use some advice.

In March 2024, I joined a very early-stage startup as the first employee and Growth Lead. Before this, I was the first Growth hire at a successful startup with a similar business model but in a different industry. While the salary here is decent for the company stage, it‚Äôs nowhere near my previous salary.

Lately, I‚Äôve started to lose motivation and confidence in the company and the founders. Here‚Äôs why:

The founders are slow to make decisions, especially on strategic priorities. Urgent matters are discussed in meetings but rarely followed up with action.  
  
I seem to be the only one implementing processes and ensuring the team sticks to them. For example, we have a cold-calling session with the Sales team, but if I‚Äôm not actively involved and making sure it happens, no one does it. The founder in charge of Sales doesn‚Äôt seem to care.

It‚Äôs a mobile app, but there‚Äôs no CTO or technical founder. Development is outsourced to an agency, resulting in sporadic feature releases. Communication with the agency has become increasingly difficult, and most releases come with significant bugs.

The founders‚Äô mood is worsening, and they seem increasingly overwhelmed, mostly due to cash flow concerns and underwhelming performance metrics.

I was initially promised 2% equity, but after a board meeting, it was revised to 1%. I still haven‚Äôt signed the paperwork as I'm waiting for them to give me the contract... They also revised my bonus to only give me the smallest tier, even though they say my performance was great.

I can‚Äôt control how the business performs, but it feels like my career is tied to its success. I‚Äôm losing motivation as my confidence in the leadership and company vision declines and ultimately I feel underpaid for everything I'm doing and how much effort I put in the startup...  
  
Is there anything I can do to improve the situation, or should I start looking elsewhere?

We faced a frustrating challenge‚Äîlow lead conversions. The sales team worked hard, but the results just weren‚Äôt there. Blame was coming on me in a way that product is not good.  I started digging deeper by taking multiple calls myself and found the core issues that were holding us back:

First, **the sales team didn‚Äôt truly understand the product.** If they didn‚Äôt know the ins and outs of what made it better than competitors, how could they convince anyone else?

Second, **they weren‚Äôt listening to customers.** Instead of focusing on what the customer needed, they were too focused on pitching the product. This led to missed opportunities to connect with potential buyers.

We also realized that **urgency was missing.** Customers had no reason to act right away. Without creating a sense of ‚Äúwhy now,‚Äù decisions were pushed aside.

Here‚Äôs what worked:

* Help your team deeply understand the product‚Äîwhat it does, why it‚Äôs special, and how it solves problems.
* Shift the focus to the customer‚Äôs needs and challenges.

Now the competitors lunched their version which pretty much includes everything, ie chefs , barbershops, yoga,doctors pretty much they made a booking handyman app (no tracking and i tested their app it‚Äôs mvp basic even worst) ,

Just to give idea how bad their app is , I can code it all in 1 day and i may finish in 2-4 hours .


 Now i‚Äôm not sure if i should rush my app to the appstore or change the app completely to match theirs .

Canada is attractive, but has a residency requirement which will add cost. 

Delaware is the usual move, but without getting political there‚Äôs about to be a lot of changes in America and not sure about stability and whatnot.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d6f,1h09972,Building a platform to automate any internal operation workflow‚Ä¶.,"Hi everybody! I‚Äôve recently thrown myself back to pursuing a new venture after having done it once. It‚Äôs been 3 months since the last, so definitely feels addictive and exciting :)

**So what problem am I trying to solve ?**

The problem I‚Äôm trying to solve is something that I experienced so many times in my previous venture, both internally and whilst working with 3rd party partners. And that‚Äôs the common challenge of internal manual ops workflows that although not part of the core IP tend to have the following negative impacts:

* Lost of customers - typically as the result of slow internal processes e.g slow customer service support
* Large operational overheard - manual workflows often requires large head counts which is costly or sometimes simply infeasible
* Costly mistake and poor collaboration - manual workflows can often lead to costly mistakes and poor collaboration between teams.

**What‚Äôs the solution ?**

Well the solution to many of these manual workflows tends to be automation, however this is not always easy because of challenges such as:

* Inadequate tooling - tools like Zapier (have used it myself) are great but more tailored workflows tend to require custom code which can be tricky with these type of tools
* Different needs for different teams - each team has unique workflows and build custom automations for each team is infeasible
* Not part of engineering priorities - engineering is often focused on product requirements and doesn‚Äôt have time for internal tools

**What am I building to solve this ?**

An AI-powered platform that allows you yo automate any operational workflow simply by drawing and describing the process workflow.

So imagine all those nitty gritty manual tasks that are either costing you time or money, with what we are building no matter how custom it is, if you can draw the process workflow, describe it, the platform will give you an automated version of it which you can then deploy internally just with the push of a button. We want to make it simple for day-to-day founders and small business to custom automations with no coding or expertise required.

I would love to engage with anyone who would love to be apart of the beta testing as we ramp up the first version (schedule for release after the Christmas break). Moreover I would love your feedback on the above, what uses-cases would you want to automate on such a platform. What solutions have you tried, if any are there things you wish you could do that you simply can‚Äôt ?",1,startups,1732618848.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h09972/building_a_platform_to_automate_any_internal/,experience

Curious about something and hoping to get your thoughts!  
I'm a bit of a podcast junkie (have spoken on a couple and easily consume 100+ a month), but lately, I've been hitting a wall finding short and good audio content that really scratches my specific interests.

So I've been experimenting with something: using AI tools to generate short, focused audio snippets about topics I'm genuinely curious about. Nothing too polished, just quick, informative 10-minute audio clips. And It's been surprisingly enjoyable!

I started thinking about building a quick prototype of an app (I'm an experienced software engineer) to do this for everybody: a daily 10min audio/podcast about either news or subjects of interest for people to listen to while commuting to work.

Assuming the audio/podcast quality is indistinguishable from real humans, would love to know:

1. Would you be more interested in hyper-personalized content about your specific interests, or quick daily news summaries?
2. What's the sweet spot for length? 10 min? 15?
3. Is this something you'd even care about, or am I just scratching my own itch?

I'm at the point in getting my new startup off the ground that I need to find a more technical partner. I've been all over Linkedin and Upwork but haven't had any success in finding the right person yet. I'm hoping ya'll can point me in the right direction to find this person.

My business is a simple services company in which clients can hire assistants through us. We have a unique list of first clients that are keen to buy from us. I'm currently managing everything in Google sheets. I need a partner that's built a customer journey system from the ground up using simple tools, but in a way that leaves room for us to scale in the future.

Ideally, the person I'm looking for wants to build something from the ground up, is open to coming on as a full time tech lead in the future, and is in a time zone similar to the US. I'd really like to work with someone in their mid to late 20s who is ready for their chance to own something. The reason I want someone in LATAM is both financial and because that's where a large part of our business is coming from.

I tried using arcdev, and similar sites, but a lot of these sites require a business domain to make an account. I'm still operating totally out of gmail and haven't even bought a domain yet so I can't get into these sites.

Where would you go to find someone like this?

The other reason I'm having trouble is because this isn't necessarily a developer, or a designer, or a PM but someone who can do it all to start out.

My co founders and I just launched our MVP platform a couple weeks ago which acts like a job aggregator for healthcare clinicians for specific jobs that are starting to be offered by hospitals right now. The current/traditional way of finding these is through a staffing agency but that means less pay for clinicians and more premium costs for employers. Our goal is to make that connection directly without the need for a middle-man.

We wouldnt get one type of user without the other so we scraped a bunch of these jobs for clinicians to view and request to apply to for free and got a little bit of traction but were struggling to get traction and in touch with the right people on the hospital side to work with us or at least provide some feedback. We know for a 100% fact they would benefit from this product though from past jobs but if it takes too long we dont want it to jeopardize our current users.

67558dbceeb7770cf0a37d81,1gzn4mv,The Top Reason You Can‚Äôt Find a Technical Co-Founder,"If you‚Äôre struggling to attract a technical co-founder, it might be because your idea lacks clarity or validation.

Developers are problem-solvers, not fortune-tellers. They need to see evidence that your idea addresses a real market need, has traction, or is backed by a clear execution plan. 

Unrealistic expectations, vague pitches, or equity-heavy offers without upfront commitment can make them hesitant. Want to win them over? Validate your concept, respect their expertise, and show you‚Äôre just as invested in the journey as they are.

Here is the framework I use:

1. Low-cost prototype creation ($100-$500)

* Clickable UI mockups
* Core user flows
* Basic branding



1. Customer validation sprint (2-3 weeks)

* 20+ user interviews
* Market sizing
* Competitor analysis
* Revenue projections



1. Find technical co-founder with proof

* Validated prototype
* User feedback data
* Revenue model
* Clear technical scope



# Equity Recommendation

* If you‚Äôve done the work listed (prototyping, validation, and planning), consider negotiating **35-45% equity** for the technical co-founder rather than 50%.

* However, 50% may still be fair if:
   * The product is highly complex and demands extensive development.
   * The technical co-founder is also taking on operational or strategic roles.
   * The project requires significant long-term technical investment.

  
Equity decisions should ultimately reflect the value of each person‚Äôs contributions and align incentives for the company‚Äôs success.

One of those friends and I always talked about starting a business importing vehicle parts and agricultural machinery to Argentina.

For different reasons (like the pandemic), we couldn‚Äôt move forward at the time, but about a year ago, we finally started working on this project seriously. On my side, I managed to get everything ready: I hired trade specialists, customs brokers, and sales agents, and I even had several potential orders lined up.

Now, I feel like I have nothing left.

This is where I could really use your advice.

Should I just cut my losses, cancel the trip, and move on?

I'm building a mobile game (Trading Card Game) in the music universe where people can collect and play real artists cards.

I have a very good product idea, but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. I want to try to test the market of this product to see if there is demand for it. This product does not exist anywhere and its a very simple product that I think should exist but doesn't. I have also been using this product like this for years and a quick Google search shows that others have too, but I can't gauge how many and it seems like it isn't a lot. 



However, now that I am working on it I notice that it is a lot harder to produce and a bit more expensive than I would've anticipated. It is an overall simple product just I will not be able to design and make it on my own but I know the product works.

  
What would be the best way to test the product like this before manufacturing? As I said, I want to ensure there is demand in this product before investing a good amount of money into it. 



My current thought process is to find a manufacturer nearby and ask if they can make the product and order a few samples. The product and packaging will be extremely basic and I plan to build a quick website, run ads and compare people who entered the site and bought the samples. This idea does seem expensive as I would need to order a lot of samples, pay an R&amp;D team to develop the product to ensure it works as intended, get a good website working and pay for advertisement as well so I was wondering if there is a cheaper alternative to this that I can do.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37d90,1gyzt48,Manufacturing an electronic product in China,"Hello,

I've worked on this product (exercising product) for around 2.5 yrs now. I took it really slow, and spent around +$15k in the development, all done by myself (and I have no prior experience developing an electronic product). the product consists of a PCBA + Enclosure + Rubber parts + Fiberglass parts. I worked directly with manufacturers in China. and after so many iterations, we were able to make the final samples.

a Quick breakdown:

**PCBA + Firmware**¬†\- I hired a freelancer to make it, then manufactured it with both JLCPCB + a CM that i found in Alibaba.

**Enclosure**¬†\- I hired a freelancer to design it - then 3d printed it.

**Rubber parts**¬†\- I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - it took several molds and attempts till we got it right.

**Fiberglass parts**¬†\- I gave the requirements + drawings to the manufacturer - and we got it right pretty quick.

I assembled the product many times that i can do it blindfolded now. I tested every aspect physically, improved the design, and got rid of things that are not necessary.

I have shown the product to people around me for testing and feedback. They liked it and the feedback was really positive. The product is really good, and exceeded all expectations (there is nothing like it in the market).

I kept the product in secret mode the majority of the time, the only person who knew 90% of the functionality was the freelancer who made the Firmware/Software for me, and he is a person that i personally trust.

I'm currently preparing a provisional patent, to start sharing the full idea with the manufacturer that will handle the manufacturing + assembly.

The product is not complicated and is very easy to understand.. IP thieves will have to figure how we did the silicon + fiberglass + firmware, in order to bring something similar to the market. My main goal is to be the first to market and not worry about these.

Now, i have the product in my hands, and don't know what to do next. it might not be the perfect version, but i think its +90% of that. and honestly, i cannot improve it any further..

The CM i found in Alibaba said that they can help with PCBA + Enclosure + Final product Assembly (after receiving the parts) + Packaging + Certifications. But, i don't know if i can trust them (They are well-known and verified though).

I keep asking myself these questions:

\- Should i go with one of these CMs? show them the product and start managing the process myself between factories ? (i don't want to give them the full responsibility - For IP)

\- What certifications will we need (we used ESP32 Module)? and how are we going to obtain it? and how can it be verified? what if we make slight modifications later to the PCBA, will we have to re-obtain these again?

\- What if the product/Assembly isn't 100% perfect? Will that matter for the first Batches? For Example: There might be a better and more reliable way to assemble certain parts and we haven't discovered it yet (even if its currently working fine).

I would appreciate any help from people who had similar experiences.

When we‚Äôre on the same Wi-Fi, uploading files to the NAS is way faster than cloud. For us constantly dealing with big files (we're talking 4K videos that are several gb each), this saves a ton of time and frustration.

Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but there‚Äôs something reassuring about keeping all data on our own drive instead of a third-party server. You know what I mean... it just feels safer? 

And upgrading cloud storage every few months cus we ran out of space was getting ridiculously expensive. With the NAS, we‚Äôve cut those fees and have way more flexibility to expand storage when we need it.

As someone who's long had entrepreneurial ambitions, I've finally settled on a project after years of consideration. I have detailed a business plan, along with other documents to lay out my startup. I was hoping to get some advice on funding options so that I am able to make this work. The main difficulty I have is that my idea is largely service-sector based, and without funds, I am not able to start up / demonstrate application. For reference, my target is roughly ¬£50-70k (depending on the scale of launch).

My current thoughts are:

Personal savings: Although I don't currently have the financial capacity for an investment of this amount, I could reach this goal within 2 or so years. However, that would be a significant delay, which is rather demotivating.

Angel investor: At the minute, my project is a mere idea. Without the funds, I am not able to demonstrate actionable application, which would make this very difficult.

Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding has provided many businesses with amazing opportunities. However, similar to angel investors, it's very difficult to galvanize the support of people without having something immediate to offer.

I would appreciate any advice on this‚Äîare there perhaps other options I've not considered? Are there ways to overcome the difficulties in my current methods?

At the moment, crowdfunding stands out to me as the most viable option. My project addresses various social objectives, which I feel could gain support from people. How am I able to promote my idea (besides platforms like Kickstarter)?

I have a niche idea for a tool/plugin that I believe could be a game-changer for content creators in the gaming/streaming space. This tool would make it 1000x easier to create a specific type of content that is already generating hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of views monthly on YouTube and other platforms. It‚Äôs especially geared toward helping smaller streamers produce this kind of content without needing the time, expertise, or resources that larger creators might have.

I don‚Äôt have a technical background, but I have experience in sales, marketing, and product ideation. While I‚Äôve never built my own product before, this idea feels worth pursuing. Would love to bring it to life, but I need some guidance on how to move forward. Here are my questions:

1. How do I find someone to create this product with me? Should I look for a technical co-founder or start with a freelancer/agency?
2. How do I protect my idea? If I share it with someone who has the technical expertise, how do I prevent them from running off with it?

If anyone has experience launching a product like this or working with developers as a non-technical founder, I‚Äôd love to hear your insights.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37da3,1gy6rqe,Is it time to migrate app code?,"Hi everyone, I'm seeking advice on whether now is a good time to migrate my company's app code from FlutterFlow. FlutterFlow has been great for our basic app needs. In this first version, the app is basically Reddit for skincare where users can make posts about different topics and interact with each other. Only photos are allowed, no video. We've recently launched this MVP on the Google and App stores (search 'Skincentric' if interested).

So far, we have 76 users and counting. I've had in depth conversations with our users and they're noticing some of the UI flaws with the app. For example, the scrolling is choppy and pages re-query every time you click to a new one so it never saves the position. Also, we'd like to implement video into the app but that has been a challenge. When we did add video, it slowed the app down drastically. At first, we used Firebase to store the video files, then we were advised to use Supabase but found little difference with SB.

So, we're wondering if cutting out FlutterFlow and just hard coding everything in Dart will help control/solve performance issues? We plan to implement even more complex features that involve machine learning which users have been asking for. FlutterFlow has served us well up until this point but I think its time to migrate. Any advice from experienced developers would help. Thanks!",4,startups,1732387787.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gy6rqe/is_it_time_to_migrate_app_code/,question

I thought creating a stunning website for my business and an Instagram account to showcase my design mastery would eventually bring in clients. And boy, was I wrong.

Then I began cold-calling people to pitch my services. I actually got a good response, with people showing genuine interest. But the problem? I didn‚Äôt know how to close the leads. As a result, despite their initial interest, none of them actually worked with me.

Next, I tried advertising that I would design webpages for free, and you‚Äôd only pay if you liked the design and decided to work with me. Again, I got a good response, but nothing materialized.

What was my mistake? I think I was focused on pitching my services instead of listening to them and quoting prices that would give me good margins. To be honest, both approaches were wrong for me.

Now, I‚Äôve shifted my approach. I listen to my clients and focus on genuinely helping them with their needs. And believe me, this change in mindset has made all the difference. In the last 7 days, I‚Äôve secured two clients‚Äîone from the US and one from Germany‚Äîand I‚Äôve received two more inquiries for work.

I don‚Äôt know if this will apply to everyone, but it worked for me:¬†**focus on the customer‚Äôs needs and problems, and figure out how you can genuinely help them.**¬†Don't worry too much about money. If you are giving value, money will eventually follow.

Background: I‚Äôm 25 and currently work in a mid-range management consulting firm (not top-tier ones like McKinsey). Back in 2019, during my second year of college, I started a startup that gained a lot of positive attention. We even pitched it to our state CM, who was impressed. Things were going well, especially during COVID when the team and I could work extensively from home. Our efforts yielded good results.

However, in my final year of college, I had to prioritize getting a job through campus placements because my parents weren‚Äôt supportive financially. My father is toxic and abusive, and I needed stability. While my co-founders wanted to go all-in on the startup, I couldn‚Äôt join them due to a lack of capital and parental support. They eventually left the startup but still hold shares. The company is still running (minimal revenue), but I‚Äôm funding it myself to keep it afloat.

Now, I‚Äôve moved out of my parents‚Äô house but still can‚Äôt quit my job since my father is retiring, and as the eldest child, I need to help my family financially. Despite this, I can‚Äôt shake off my entrepreneurial spirit.

Question:
I‚Äôve been mentoring kids through Nasscom Foundation and helping friends with their ventures, and I‚Äôve found a deep passion for it. The work aligns with my consulting job, and I‚Äôve become good at problem-solving and structuring strategies. For instance, I was paid well for a two-month part-time consulting gig with Nasscom.

Recently, I helped a friend, and they suggested I start a side hustle offering consulting services. This idea resonates with me because it could create a side income to help me eventually leave my job and fully pursue my venture. My main interest lies in tech for good.

As founders, we often wear multiple hats‚Äîvisionary, manager, marketer, and even developer. But one of the toughest challenges I‚Äôve faced (and seen others face) is managing time effectively. Here are three strategies that have helped me stay focused and productive:

1. Prioritize ruthlessly: Not all tasks are created equal. I use the 80/20 rule to focus on the 20% of tasks that drive 80% of results. For example, spending time on customer feedback is usually more impactful than tweaking internal processes.

2. Time blocking: I block specific hours for deep work, meetings, and even breaks. By giving structure to my day, I avoid the trap of reacting to every notification or email.

3. Delegate and automate: It‚Äôs tempting to do everything yourself, but as your business grows, you need to trust your team and invest in tools that automate repetitive tasks. This frees up your time for strategic thinking.

Founders often feel like there‚Äôs never enough time, but learning to manage it well is a superpower. Remember: your time is one of your most valuable resources.

wwwdotanother-fucking-saasdotshop

wwwdotanother-fucking-saas-hiringdotbiz

The obvious thing to do is buy as many TLD's as we can, but SLD's we're just kinda shit outta luck. Any time we see another TLD sending emails I write to the domain provider and they shut it down pretty quickly, but it's fucking whack-a-mole.

The part that I really don't know HOW to manage though, is the linkedin and google mail spam. People are catfishing/impersonating our real employees and sending job offers to people.

Unfortunately, I'm the closest thing to IT that we have...since I'm building the product, I'm the 'computer guy'. I'm OK doing this, but unfortunately I don't actually know WHAT to do. I reached out to an old CTO and he said to buy every TLD under the sun, so check there I guess.

But, as far as Linkedin, general catfishing, is there ANYTHING we can do other than ignore it all? I'm worried it's making us look bad. How common is this with other growing startups/businesses? Are we just unlucky? Or is this just what happens at this stage?

* paying 3x free cash flows in cash on close; no future payments/earnouts
* Annual recurring revenue (ARR) has been slightly declining for 18 months (-7%/year)
* nearly 2k trials in the last year with 29% conversion rate
* net churn is 25% (ouch) - exit survey indicates apathy with product, mismatch of expectations, bugs, and missing features are the main causes of cancellation

Text to speech is a pretty big and growing market with a lot of different applications and no network affects  or other things that would make me think it's a winner take all situation. I'd by absolutely singing with 10,000 of speechify's 20m users.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37db6,1gx88la,My first startup failed ‚Äì Here are 10 things I wish I'd do differently,"I dedicated two years of my life to a startup that ultimately failed. We were trying to build a mobile app which would simplify the life of people with diabetes. The whole journey was interesting but also a tough experience, so here are the mistakes I made and the valuable lessons I learned:

1. **All founders were technical:**
   * We were three founders, all technical, with no experience or motivation for marketing and sales.
   * A team needs balance. You can‚Äôt ignore the business side of things.
2. **Overcomplicating the MVP:**
   * We built way too many features and developed the app simultaneously for both Android and iOS.
   * It would have been much better to validate the idea on a single platform and focus on one core feature first.
3. **No competition isn‚Äôt a good thing:**
   * We did a research of competitors but we haven't find any. We thought a lack of competitors was a sign of opportunity, but it should be a warning sign instead. If no one else is in the space, it most of the time means there‚Äôs no demand for a product like this.
4. **Skipping idea validation and feedback:**
   * We didn‚Äôt validate our idea or gather feedback from potential users.
   * If we‚Äôd spent a few weeks talking to people, we could‚Äôve identified their real pain points and built something they actually needed.
5. **Ignoring monetization:**
   * We didn‚Äôt think about how we‚Äôd make money at all. We should think about that from the start.
6. **No dedicated marketing effort:**
   * We spent hundreds of hours building the product but no one was focused on marketing.
   * You need someone on the team who would put as much effort into marketing as the developers do into building.
7. **Changing habits of your users is extremely hard:**
   * Our product required users to change their routines which is a huge challenge. A better approach would‚Äôve been solving a problem they already had, not trying to create new behaviors.
8. **Wasting money on tools and infrastructure:**
   * We spent quite a lot of money on hosting, email services, certifications, legal entity creation and servers. If we'd do a better research, we could get a lot of these tools for free or at least cheaper.
9. **No energy for marketing after launch:**
   * We spent so much time and energy developing the product that by the time we launched, we were exhausted and demotivated.
   * Marketing is critical at launch, but we didn‚Äôt have the energy to start when it mattered most.
10. **Underestimating the importance of networking:**

   * We didn‚Äôt actively seek out mentors, advisors, or partnerships that could have guided us or opened doors.
   * Building connections with the people that are already in the industry might have helped us validate our idea and find early adopters.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37dba,1gx5iqf,[Startup] SV law firm is secretly testing our AI patent tool - here's how we got there,"Got quoted $800 for a provisional patent this year working with . Being stubborn (and at the time, broke), we started playing with AI to see if it could help structure patent applications properly.

Spent months learning USPTO formatting requirements and feeding different patterns to the AI. Most attempts were garbage. The breakthrough came when I figured out how to make it structure technical descriptions properly.

Weird turn of events: Was showing a friend (who works at a SV patent firm) my terrible attempts, and his response surprised me: ""This... actually follows proper format?""

Now that same firm is testing it. It's been surreal seeing attorneys actually use something I built while messing around.

Current state:

\- Drafts basic provisional patents (working with firm on full patent app generator)

\- Actually works (shocking)

\- Lots of security issues to fix

\- Still figuring out next steps

Lessons learned:

1. Patent formatting is weirdly specific
2. AI hallucinates technical details a lot
3. Lawyers spend too much time on initial drafts
4. Security/privacy is everything with IP

The fun part has been seeing test inventions people try - ""AI-powered socks that sort themselves"" is still my favorite üòÇ

Would love feedback from anyone who's dealt with patents before. Still lots to figure out.

Also not sure on GTM. Thinking initially was target founders but there's not many that need patents and those that do are serious about it and will hire firm.... Thinking now is maybe lawyers will use this internally but other than my friend, most firms have not been very receptive to incorporating AI into their workflow.... (or at least their bosses haven't)

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37dc6,1gwu3ts,Idea Validation: AI-Powered Lyric Replacement Program,"I've been thinking about an idea and wanted to get some feedback on its feasibility and whether it might have any real business demand. The concept involves using AI to personalize songs by replacing part or all of the lyrics while preserving the original artist's unique vocal style.

The idea is to uses AI to change lyrics in a song while keeping the original artist's unique voice and style. For example, if there‚Äôs a song where the artist sings someone‚Äôs name, this system could swap that name out for a different one, and it‚Äôll still sound like the same artist singing it, with the same tone, style, and emotion. This could be used in music streaming platforms to create personalized song, or in apps like TikTok to generate custom audio tracks for user-generated content.

How It Works:
The AI is trained using recordings of the artist‚Äôs voice, along with the musical scores and lyrics (or phonemes). This helps the system learn how the artist sings‚Äîlike their tone, pitch, and timing.
When it‚Äôs time to make changes, the program takes the original song, separates the voice from the instruments, and identifies the part of the vocal line to change. Then, using the new lyrics and pitch details from the original song, it generates a new vocal segment that sounds just like the artist. This new piece is added back to the song, replacing the old section.

Example Use Case:
Imagine a song where the artist sings, ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Sarah.‚Äù With this system, you could change ""Sarah"" to another name, like ""David,"" and it would still sound like the same artist singing it. The rest of the song stays untouched‚Äîsame voice, same style, same everything‚Äîjust a new name in the lyrics.

It could also be used to:

Localize songs into different languages while keeping the artist's original singing style.

Create clean versions of songs by swapping out explicit lyrics.

This is an easy way to personalize or adapt music without needing the artist to re-record anything.

This process can currently be achieved through methods like recording a new version of the song with the desired lyrics and then use voice conversion, or through extensive audio editing and manual adjustments. However, my goal is to create a more streamlined and efficient approach that automates this process using AI, making it faster and more accessible while maintaining the quality and authenticity of the original performance.

I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts on whether this idea seems technically viable and if there‚Äôs a market for such a feature in the music or entertainment industries.

Some context: I started a SAAS to solve a simple but critical problem - helping DTC brands keep their customer data longer than the 7-day cookie window that's killing most mobile marketing efforts. We basically help brands implement server-side tracking and better use their first-party data for Meta ads and email marketing.

This means we were sitting on a goldmine of behavioral data (think millions of pre-purchase signals) and didn't even know it. We're the first point of interaction between customers and brands after all! This realization led to spending \~4 mo analyzing trends across our biggest performance wear clients.

What we found was fascinating:

* Cult sports are completely changing how brands succeed
* Traditional marketing playbooks are becoming obsolete
* First-party data is creating massive competitive advantages

And the numbers to back it all up.  
  
I ended up compiling our findings in to a whitepaper and started sharing it exclusively with industry leaders. The response was insane: **7x growth in inbound leads, multiple enterprise brands reaching out, speaking opportunities at industry events**

Key lessons learned:

1. Sometimes your best asset isn't your product, but your position in the market
2. Data without insight is just numbers
3. Sharing knowledge builds more trust than traditional marketing (!!!!!)

As startup and one of the challenging things to manage was internal operations especially given that it was a fintech driven business serving merchants. As is usual with many startups there were a number of manual operational workflows, but where it becomes a bit challenging is when some of these manual workflows although not part of your IP start to slow you down, but given your resources you unfortunately cannot dedicate resources for said development, so you piece workarounds. Internal drag-and-drop tools can sometimes help but for more complex workflows can be hard to work with.

These challenges sometimes tend to get better as you grow but typically at the expense of an increased head count and bloated operations costs. Which can hinder growth, I have seen this manual workflows persists at both and even some large companies so no one is immune. These manual workflows can range anywhere from internal customer onboarding, data entry, data transformation tasks to mundane sales and marketing ops tasks and sometimes when not done optimally can be costly, I remember how painful it was when we lost a few merchants due to some of the challenges above.

So I would love to open a discussion regarding how do you currently manage internal ops workflows especially with the advent of AI,  
\- how do these workflows look like ?  
\- what is the hardest thing about executing or maintaining these workflows ?  
\- why is hard and how often do you have to execute these workflows ?

Over the past year, I‚Äôve created a much better version and put in significantly more time and effort. We‚Äôve attracted interest from two major B2B prospects, which feels like great progress.

However, things have gone south recently. She hired a lawyer to incorporate the company and now says 50/50 isn‚Äôt fair. She wants to reduce my share to 25%, even though she admits I‚Äôve contributed more and am responsible for the technical success so far.

There are other frustrations, too:

She‚Äôs unhappy with a few bugs and said that as CTO, I‚Äôm responsible for UX as well. I was expecting her to define how users interact with the product, but when I said I‚Äôd need to code less to focus on research and customer conversations, she said that‚Äôs not her problem.

My laptop broke yesterday, and I need $2K(or 5 for a new) for a replacement to keep developing. She said it‚Äôs my issue to solve, just like hosting and subscription costs, which I‚Äôve been covering alone.


From my perspective, it feels unfair to continue this alone or even bring in a new CEO, though one person has already expressed interest in stepping into that role.

I‚Äôm okay cutting my losses if necessary. However, we have two product demos scheduled next week with potential new customers, and I feel like the trust is completely gone. I‚Äôm unsure what to do with the data and code if I leave.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37de2,1gw49fe,"Building with urgency, and why I think it matters","Just wanted to throw this one down because I've been getting a lot of questions from founders about losing their motivation and fire to build. 

Every founder goes through a honeymoon phase at the beginning, but like everything, that excitement fizzles out over the long term, especially when things get tough. 

I hope this helps. Enjoy.

\--

Building with urgency is probably one of the most underrated skills a founder can master.

Over the years, I‚Äôve seen too many founders lose focus because they lost their sense of urgency, but I also figured out how some founders regained and even doubled down on their focus by following some simple habits that anyone can use.

But first, let‚Äôs get one thing straight:

If you‚Äôre building something especially in the SaaS space, the idea that ‚Äúgreat things take time‚Äù, can be safely thrown out the window - time is a luxury we don‚Äôt have anymore.¬†

But why?

AI has changed the landscape and it‚Äôs now easier to build software companies than ever before.

But that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶

Every idea has 10+ VC-backed and bootstrapped competitors out there.

Speed and momentum become everything.

That‚Äôs why building with a sense of urgency is a HUGE unlock; because it might be the single biggest thing that will separate you from everyone else.

But what are some ways to do it properly?

1. **Set clear deadlines**¬†‚Äî these could be real or artificial, but you have to really stick to them. They have to be aggressive but realistic. It‚Äôs even better if you can justify the timelines to yourself and your team. Deadlines, especially with consequences create a strong urge to get things done.
2. **Have a mission/north star**¬†‚Äî working towards something bigger than yourself becomes magnetic. While OKRs are great to have, having that purpose alongside timelines creates a potent combination of things to do!
3. **Be accountable**¬†‚Äî this becomes really important when you‚Äôre either a small team or a solopreneur. It‚Äôs a double-edged sword because you‚Äôre not beholden to anyone except yourself and the business. This means you can take as much time as you want on a project and not be at risk of being fired. But if you find that you still can‚Äôt be accountable to yourself, then be accountable to your investors and/or your customers that believe in you. Ironically, accountability towards others is more powerful than towards yourself.
4. **Simplify your roadmap**¬†‚Äî focus on what really matters to move the needle for your biz. Remove all the nice-to-haves and just get the essentials out to the world - remember, done is way better than perfect.
5. **Iterate**¬†‚Äî keep testing and updating the product. But the real key here is that the act of iterating becomes a fly-wheel. As you gather more feedback, you‚Äôll be motivated to correct, improve, and release new updates back to your customers. This is why it‚Äôs so important to get your product into the hands of as many people as possible - it generates that momentum.

The founders who do this well have this maniacal obsession about progress.

They want to see stuff get done, people taking action, and moving the needle as much as possible in the right direction.

What you realize is that when you do this enough times, the notion of urgency becomes the default for you and your team - it becomes deeply embedded in your culture.

I‚Äôm a digital nomad currently based in the U.S., but I travel a lot and love the freedom this lifestyle brings. Right now, I‚Äôm in the process of building my own startup, and I‚Äôve been deeply inspired by Pieter Levels‚Äô journey.

For those who may not know, Pieter Levels is a well-known digital nomad who‚Äôs built multiple highly profitable businesses, including Nomad List, Remote OK, PhotoAi, and even a merchandise business. Beyond websites, he also generates income through YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and other streams. He‚Äôs an incredible example of how someone can bootstrap and scale multiple businesses while staying remote.

**Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm curious about:**

1. **Business Structure:**¬†Does anyone know how entrepreneurs like Pieter set up their business income streams? Are they typically routed through a single entity like an LLC, or are they managed as separate entities for each project? If everything is routed through the LLC, should the LLC elect s-corp status?
2. **Taxes for Nomads:**¬†As someone living the nomadic lifestyle, how do you manage taxes when you‚Äôre earning from multiple sources across different jurisdictions? Do you consolidate everything under one tax structure or file separately for each income stream? Especially since I live across many states in the US, does that mean i have to file taxes at all these states? Also my websites operate worldwide, so how would taxes in general work? I heard Wyoming is a good place to set up the LLC because of the flexibility and zero state taxes it provides.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to structure my own business as I grow and diversify, and I‚Äôd love to hear your insights. If you‚Äôre juggling multiple ventures or have advice on simplifying operations while staying nomadic, I‚Äôd be super grateful for your input!

*Context* 

I stumbled upon a problem in the marketing and content asset management space. While there are some solutions that solve the problem in fragments, I was sure a holistic approach would work. I set out to build a product prototype in Bubble.io. 

I showed the idea and the WIP prototype to a few angel investors and they loved it. They‚Äôre willing to invest in getting this product out quickly and into the hands of customers.

67558dc2eeb7770cf0a37df1,1gvtpqv,Thoughts on fractional CTO?,"I‚Äôve been bootstrapping my startup for the past year, trying to retain as much equity as possible. Now that the MVP is nearly complete, I‚Äôm actively seeking a CTO. Recently, the idea of bringing on a fractional CTO came up as a way to avoid giving away too much equity.

However, as I‚Äôve started reaching out to investors and VCs, they consistently emphasize the importance of having a CTO in place to raise capital.

Has anyone here had experience working with a fractional CTO? Were you able to successfully raise funds with this arrangement? How do investors and VCs generally perceive it? Are investors more open to fractional CTOs in early-stage startups, or do they generally see it as a red flag?

I‚Äôm drawn to the idea because it minimizes equity dilution, but I‚Äôm also aware of the need for full commitment to scale the project moving forward.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences.

I coded the app and backend, but my design skills already hit their limit. We are based in Munich and are asking ourselves, what is the best move going forward. The options are:

*  Get a full time designer - Hard to justify as we don't have enough tasks to keep the designer busy full time in the next 6 months. 
* Get a local freelancer - We tried these two times but were not very happy with the results
* Use Upwork - We are currently leaning into this one but have not heard success stories from this approach
* Get references for freelancers - While it makes sense, we are seeing that is not easy to hit the venn diagram in what we are looking for and good recommendations from peers - perhaps just need to keep asking around.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37dfd,1gvj8f5,Quickly estimating the value of your startup equity,"Please, please, please... make sure you understand the potential value of your equity, whether you're currently employed at a startup or evaluating an offer letter. Here's a quick way to estimate your equity:

1. **Estimate acquisition price (ARR x exit multiples)**
   * Look up industry multiples. For B2B SaaS companies, typical exit multiples might be:
      * Low end: 5√ó ARR
      * Average: 10√ó ARR
      * Good: 15√ó ARR
      * Best-in-class: 20‚Äì25√ó ARR (often through strategic acquisitions)
2. **Make an acquisition fee assumption**
   * Assume 10% in fees. This covers costs like investment banking, due diligence, legal, and consulting fees. So, 10% will come off the top of the acquisition price
3. **Look up equity capital raised**
   * Equity capital raised is typically preferred equity, which gets paid back at sale to preferred shareholders (investors) before common shareholders see proceeds. This can be typically found online on Crunchbase or by adding up all the funding rounds
4. **Determine your equity ownership**
   * Divide your shares by the total fully diluted shares outstanding. Note: You likely do not have direct access to the cap table, but it is appropriate to ask for the # of shares outstanding when receiving an offer. If your a current employee, ask someone with access.
5. **Calculate your cost to exercise**
   * Multiply your shares by your strike price(s). This is what you'll pay to exercise your stock options. Note: I wont be discussing this in the post, but be mindful of AMT tax implications on the delta between the FMV and strike
6. **Determine net gain or loss on equity**
   * Equity value = (((Acquisition Price √ó (1 - Acquisition Fee %)) - Capital Raised) √ó Your Ownership %) - Cost to Exercise

**Let's take a look at an example for B2B SaaS**

Details

* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $20 million
* Potential Exit Multiples: 5√ó, 10√ó, and 15√ó ARR
* Acquisition Fees: 10% of acquisition price
* Capital Raised: $80 million
* Total Shares Outstanding (Fully Diluted): 40 million shares
* Your Shares: 175,000 shares
* Your Ownership Percentage: 175,000 / 40,000,000 =0 .4375%
* Strike Price per Share: $1.25
* Cost to Exercise: 175,000¬†shares √ó $1.25 = $218,750

Calculation (for 10x multiple estimate)

* Company purchase price: $20m \* 10m
* Proceeds after fees: $200m √ó (1‚àí0.10) = $180m
* Proceeds after paying back investors: $180m ‚àí$80m = $100m
* Value of your equity: $100m √ó 0.4375% = $437.5k
* Net gain/loss on equity (adjusted for exercise cost) = $437.5k ‚àí $218.75k = $218.75k

Net gain or loss on equity

|100m (5x ARR)|200m (10x ARR)|300m (15x ARR)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|\-$175k|$218.75k|$612.5k|

Yes, you read that right, the employee actually lost money at the $100m exit, due to the capital raised and the cost to exercise exceeding your share of the proceeds. There are 100s of other variables that could influence your exit potential; that being said, this is a good general framework for getting a ballpark idea.",13,startups,1732083698.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gvj8f5/quickly_estimating_the_value_of_your_startup/,question

I have a background in Mechanical Engineering/Robotics (both undergrad and grad school), and I taught myself coding. I‚Äôm currently working in the Bay Area at a cutting-edge company in computer vision research, although I‚Äôm just starting to dive deeper into it.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on a few things as I plan for the future:

**1. How did people in similar situations make the jump into doing a startup?**  
I know I have the potential to start a company, and I really want to do it eventually, but I feel I need to work on myself a bit more before jumping in. The problem is, I don't have a strong financial situation (though I‚Äôm building it now). My family has only been debt-free for the last few years, and I was able to secure funding during my master's. That said, I want to make sure I‚Äôm ready both technically and financially. For those of you who‚Äôve made the leap into starting a business from a tech career, how did you make that transition? How did you deal with the financial challenges?

**2. How do startup founders balance having a deep technical understanding, market awareness, and competition insight?**  
One of the challenges I‚Äôm facing is how startup people have a solid understanding of the technical side of things *and* the market, competition, and business strategy. I want to be able to have the technical knowledge to build something meaningful, but I also need to understand the larger context. How do founders typically get a good understanding of both?

**3. How do you keep up with trends in the ML field?**  
This one is specific to my current focus: Machine Learning, especially in the realm of computer vision and reasoning. I‚Äôve been struggling to keep up with the trends in the field and feel like my understanding of core concepts is still lacking. I know I need to improve my discipline and push myself to learn more, but it‚Äôs a steep curve. How do you guys keep up with fast-evolving technologies, particularly in ML? Do you have any resources, routines, or strategies that have helped you self-improve?

**4. How can I leverage my current job at a good company for future goals?**  
I‚Äôm working in a cutting-edge company for computer vision research right now, though I don‚Äôt work directly on the computer vision aspect yet. I‚Äôm still just getting started. How can I leverage my position in a high-tech company to build my knowledge, grow my network, and prepare for a future startup? What‚Äôs the best way to use this environment to my advantage while still focusing on building my own business?

**Summary**:

* I want to start a company in the future, but I‚Äôm still building up my technical skills and financial situation.
* I‚Äôm currently working in computer vision/ML, but I want to deepen my understanding and stay on top of trends.
* I struggle with self-discipline and staying focused when working alone, but I know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs necessary for a startup.

I'm setting up a monthly subscription service (selling services) where most of my clients would be in the U.S. For this, I thought about using Stripe, as it's well-known and inspires a lot of trust among Americans, but they don't operate in Argentina (Where I'm from and pay taxes from). You can set up an LLC and open a bank account in the U.S. to use Stripe that way, but I was advised that this could be complicated and costly (it ends up getting a good part of your earnings if you're not making a lot of money).

My question is: What do you think is the best way to go about this? Maybe setting up an LLC in the U.S. is a hassle, but it‚Äôs the most viable option. Perhaps setting up a company in Europe is easier/cheaper? Or maybe there's another service I can use directly, where I can skip the LLC/consultation and still achieve my goal of a monthly subscription in USD.

Some extra info: I'm from Argentina but I also have an Italian citizenship/passport. Maybe this is useful for setting up an LLC in Europe.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e16,1gukuuk,"Focus on the problem, not the solution
","One of the biggest misconceptions that I‚Äôve seen with founders on their pitches is around focusing on the problem vs. the solution.

Especially with the advent of GenAI, I started to notice that 8/10 pitches mentioned a lot more about the solution than the problem.¬†

I would hear from founders how AI would be used to do these cool things, but there was very little talk about how it was solving the actual problem in depth - it became a bad habit.

Side note: AI fatigue is real.

The best pitches I‚Äôve seen are the ones that can strike a good balance between both, but they‚Äôre also the ones that have a higher probability of long-term success.¬†

Let‚Äôs talk about a few reasons why this is so important‚Ä¶

‚Äî

Solutions (i.e. the product) change at a faster rate than the problem - you‚Äôre building, testing, and iterating much more quickly. This is because of customer feedback and new insights along your product journey. It‚Äôs not unnatural to pivot multiple times.

The \*problem\* however is much more rigid, and less likely to change (but there are exceptions!)

Ideally, the natural path to take is to identify a core problem, and then find a solution around it. What you don‚Äôt want to do is the reverse.¬†

I‚Äôve seen examples of founders trying to mold a problem to fit their solution.¬†

You can end up building something irrelevant consuming huge amounts of time, money, and resources into solving a particular problem that should have never existed.¬†

But how do you know when a problem needs fixing?¬†

That‚Äôs when it becomes unique to the founder. Those who are obsessed with the problem are usually the ones who can go the furthest.¬†

The problem needs to bother you A LOT.¬†

It‚Äôs when obsession takes over.

It needs to get under your skin and create discomfort for you to the point where you can‚Äôt get it off your mind.¬†

The great thing about this approach is that this type of relentlessness will take you down a rabbit hole you actually want to go down.¬†

If the problem matters to you enough, eventually you become fully immersed and relentless in understanding \*why\* the problem exists and matters to you.

It means that the best problems to solve are also the ones worth solving but hidden in plain sight.

The plus side is that those who stay problem-focused unlock insights that their competitors miss.

But problems that could be solved don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum - it needs a solution.¬†

So going back to the pitches:

As mentioned previously, the most memorable pitches are the ones that can do the balancing act between problem and solution, but they also tell a great story about the problem and why it needs addressing.

They then use the problem as a segue into their solution.

But in many cases, the solution itself can convey a ‚Äòset-in-stone‚Äô perspective of what the company is (or will be) doing.¬†

However, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.

The solution presented in the deck could change a number of times.¬†

The reality is that it‚Äôs not about having THE solution, but it‚Äôs having A solution, especially at such an early stage.

Any thoughtful solution to a worthwhile problem is worth building.¬†

The goal is to get your initial solution in the hands of your ideal customer as quickly as possible and iterate from there.

It‚Äôs about finding what works and if the solution is truly addressing the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve.

You‚Äôre not going to get it right the first time, so it‚Äôs best to build early and deploy fast.

Over time, you‚Äôll refine the solution and have a much better understanding of the problem. This will then feed back into the investment deck, and all the branding and marketing materials that come with it.

Ultimately, the companies and brands that have longevity are the ones who are completely locked into the problem they want to solve. They understand the problem intimately, better than anyone else, and also have the capabilities to solve it.",10,startups,1731977845.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gukuuk/focus_on_the_problem_not_the_solution/,experience

|**Platform**|**Low CPC**|**Average CPC**|**High CPC**|**Notes**|

|**Facebook**|$0.30|$0.80|$2.00|Lower costs for broad targeting, higher for specific travel intent.|
|**Instagram**|$0.40|$1.20|$3.00|Higher engagement but generally more expensive than Facebook.|
|**YouTube**|$0.10|$0.30|$4.00|Video views can be cheap, but travel-related clicks can cost more.|
|**Pinterest**|$0.10|$0.70|$1.50|Great for travel inspiration with relatively low competition.|
|**Google Ads**|$0.50|$2.50|$5.00+|Travel is competitive, especially for popular destinations like Las Vegas.|
|**Twitter (X)**|$0.20|$0.80|$2.50|Less travel-focused but good for real-time promotions.|

First-timer college student here looking for your advice!

I got a job offer at a startup so far consisting of 7 people including the 3 founders, most of them are still college students or just graduated, they have one co-founder with a master's in business. 
They started almost a year ago and have a couple of clients already but no liquidity. It‚Äôs a B2B software business and they want to hire me as one of the leads for the development of a new product.
So far I have been working with them for a month now to see how it goes. During this time I offered my experience and advice in crucial DevOps decisions that they were very in need of and started outlining the new project.

Now it comes the time when we finally write  up a contract and here‚Äôs the deal: They can‚Äôt offer money as compensation (at least not from them) as they have no liquidity. (Nobody else at the company is getting paid atm and the founders are still investing in the company.)

Currently, I‚Äôm being offered a 0-hour contract with government financial support that you receive if you work in the Netherlands, two subscriptions that I need to work, an office space, a fancy title, and the ‚Äúright of pre-emption for any funding rounds or distribution of equity‚Äù.

Since I‚Äôm risking enough by agreeing to something with no compensation I‚Äôd like to get something out of it if everything goes well.

So I would like to ask your advice on what kind of better equity options can I negotiate according to the circumstances.

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e28,1gtzri9,"Co-Founder Conflict and Missed Targets in Our Startup:  What Should I Do ?
","I am the co-founder of a ticketing platform (SaaS &amp; marketplace) based in Africa. My CTO and I started this journey in 2022, aiming to solve a major market problem in the events industry in Africa. Our vision was clear: create a platform that simplifies ticketing and access control while offering an accessible marketplace for event organizers and attendees. Initially, I approached him to hire him for system development, but he proposed we partner instead. Believing in his technical expertise and passion for the vision, I agreed, and we started the business with a shareholding structure of 65% (me) and 35% (CTO).

At the start, we shared a mutual enthusiasm for the project, but over time, our visions for the business began to diverge. These differences have gradually led to conflicts regarding the goals, target market, and overall approach to running the business. Our business development efforts and system development processes have become completely disintegrated. What‚Äôs more, I‚Äôve found myself increasingly excluded from the technical side of things. Despite my repeated efforts to be kept in the loop about development progress, my CTO continues to operate in isolation, leaving me in the dark.

When we initially launched the partnership, we agreed to use the lean methodology. Our goal was to launch an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within 2022 to quickly gather user feedback and iterate based on market needs. However, we only managed to release a basic system for managing access control and generating hardcopy tickets‚Äîand this didn‚Äôt happen until 2023. I felt this was an unnecessary delay, as the initial scope of work was straightforward.

By early 2024, my CTO admitted that the workload was overwhelming, and we decided to hire additional help. We brought on board one developer and an intern, thinking this would ease the burden and accelerate progress. We set a three-month target to release V1 of the platform, with clear priorities and a defined scope. However, my CTO continued to add features outside the agreed scope, causing significant delays. As of today, we have yet to launch anything meaningful. In total, this means we‚Äôve failed to launch a functional product since 2022‚Äîa reality that is increasingly disheartening for me as a co-founder.

To make matters worse, my CTO frequently takes on side gigs, often working with the same developer we hired to help with our project ( They are all on salary ). While I understand the need for financial stability in a bootstrapped startup, this directly impacts our progress and focus. Missing deadlines has become the norm, and the lack of accountability has led to lost opportunities. Some of our existing clients have even begun moving to competitors because our offerings remain limited. This is incredibly frustrating, as I‚Äôve made multiple attempts to address the issue by discussing how the lack of communication and missed deadlines affect the business. Unfortunately, these discussions haven‚Äôt brought about any meaningful changes.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that we don‚Äôt have any formal agreements beyond the company incorporation documents. We never established detailed operational agreements or governance structures to guide decision-making or accountability. While this may have been fine in the beginning, it has now become a glaring issue as conflicts arise. Looking back, I take responsibility for not pushing harder to formalize regular meetings and progress reviews. Without these, it‚Äôs been difficult to align on priorities and address concerns effectively.

We are also operating from a rented flat, which serves as both our workplace and living space. This arrangement, paid for through company funds, initially seemed cost-effective but has contributed to blurring the lines between work and personal boundaries. It has also made it harder to separate professional disagreements from personal conflicts, further complicating the partnership.

For context, I‚Äôve put everything into this business. From May 2022 until August 2024, I worked tirelessly‚Äîoften 15-hour days without a single day off and without taking a salary. I only started drawing a salary in April 2024, but even then, I‚Äôve kept it minimal to keep our expenses manageable. My motivation has always been the belief that we‚Äôre solving an important market problem, particularly in Africa‚Äôs events industry. However, as the time go by and progress remains stagnant, I‚Äôm starting to doubt whether we have the right team to execute this vision. I‚Äôm questioning whether it‚Äôs time to make some hard decisions for the sake of my own well-being and the future of the business.

Currently, I‚Äôm considering two options:

Option 1: Fire My CTO

One option is to terminate my CTO‚Äôs involvement in the business. While this might seem like the most straightforward solution, it‚Äôs not without significant risks. My CTO has been the technical lead from the start, and his removal would likely create a power vacuum and disrupt the already fragile development process. Given that we‚Äôre a small team, losing him would set us back significantly in terms of product development. Additionally, firing him could escalate tensions and lead to legal disputes, albeit with differing shareholding percentages.

On the other hand, his continued involvement is hindering progress. His lack of accountability and focus is directly impacting our ability to meet targets and grow the business. If I were to replace him, I would need to find a technical lead who not only understands our current development status but also aligns with the vision of the business. This would take time and resources‚Äîboth of which are already stretched thin. The question remains: would firing him ultimately save the business or push us further into chaos?

Option 2: Let the Business Fail

The second option is to accept that we‚Äôre not the right team to execute this vision and allow the business to fail. This would involve letting the partnership dissolve naturally, either through mutual agreement or as a result of financial constraints. While this is not the outcome I want, it might be the most realistic one given the current circumstances. If the business were to collapse, I could take the lessons I‚Äôve learned from this partnership and apply them to future projects. I‚Äôd also consider picking up the parts of the business that still have potential in the African market, such as the ticketing and access control systems.

However, letting the business fail comes with its own set of challenges. We‚Äôve already invested significant time, effort, and resources into this project. Walking away now would feel like giving up on something that has the potential to succeed with the right execution. It would also mean leaving behind the clients and partners who have placed their trust in us. Moreover, there‚Äôs the emotional toll of watching something I‚Äôve poured my heart into come to an end.

My Current Reflection

As I reflect on these two options, I can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of failure. I started this journey with so much enthusiasm and belief in the impact we could make. For the first two years, I was highly motivated, working long hours without compensation because I believed in the vision. But now, that motivation is waning as the reality of our disorganization and lack of alignment becomes more apparent.

I also recognize my own shortcomings in this situation. For instance, I should have pushed harder for formal agreements and regular meetings to ensure transparency and accountability. I also should have addressed the issue of side gigs earlier, as this has clearly impacted our ability to meet targets. While it‚Äôs easy to place blame on my CTO, I know that I share responsibility for some of the challenges we‚Äôre facing.

At this point, I‚Äôm seeking advice from those who have faced similar situations. What would you do in my position? Is it worth salvaging this partnership and trying to realign our efforts, or is it time to cut my losses and move on? Are there other options I haven‚Äôt considered that could help us get back on track?

Any insights, advice, or shared experiences would be deeply appreciated as I navigate this difficult decision.",19,startups,1731916326.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gtzri9/cofounder_conflict_and_missed_targets_in_our/,experience
67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e29,1gtytu9,87.7% of entrepreneurs struggle with at least one mental health issue,"Hey,

I was procrastinating a little bit, looking at random posts on reddit and articles on google and I came across this thing on a website called Founder Reports. Now I don't get shocked easily because I know that we have a mental health crisis going on that no one really talks about but 87,7% is just too much IMO. 

I wonder why isn't anyone talking about this? And if they are it's not enough. Imagine you sat 10 people in a room and 9 of them had a mental health problem going on. That would be quite concerning. 

The thing with us entrepreneurs is, we don't really care about anything else but success, whatever it may be. And we are willing to risk it all, even at the expense of our mental health. But what happens if you don't make it and it gets worse I ask myself? What then? Do we just ""thug"" it out? Do we tell someone? Oh, but what if they don't understand us? It's normal for entrepreneurs to try and figure things out by themselves but what If they can't? What then? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for all of us or are some destined for misery their whole life? This is a really shocking statistic and a huge problem in our circle. I'm lucky and have friends who are also entrepreneurs and we can talk about our struggles (business and mental), but many people don't.

I think the bigger issue is that we‚Äôve normalized suffering as part of the entrepreneurial journey. ""Hustle culture"" tells us to work harder, sleep less, and figure it all out on our own. But at what cost? If 87.7% of us are struggling with mental health issues, then clearly, something is broken. We‚Äôre told to be resilient, but resilience shouldn‚Äôt mean ignoring our well-being...

What‚Äôs worse is that many of us don‚Äôt have a support system in place. Like I said, some entrepreneurs are lucky enough to have friends who get it, but what about the ones who don‚Äôt? Who do they talk to when the stress becomes unbearable? And how do they even bring it up without feeling like they‚Äôre admitting failure?

I don‚Äôt have all the answers, but I think we need to talk about this more. We need safe spaces where founders can openly share their struggles without judgment. Maybe it‚Äôs an online community, a meetup, or even just a buddy system where you check in with someone who understands what you‚Äôre going through.

What do you guys think? Is there something that has helped you manage the mental toll of being an entrepreneur and running your own business? Or are you just pushing through, hoping it gets better? Let‚Äôs have an honest conversation about this because 87.7% is way too high, and we need to do better‚Äînot just for ourselves, but for the people who depend on us.",0,startups,1731912214.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gtytu9/877_of_entrepreneurs_struggle_with_at_least_one/,question

My partner and I are developing an online tool to aid decision-making in a specific industry. The tool processes vast amounts of data from a massive database, presenting clear and concise insights. To our knowledge, there‚Äôs nothing like it currently available for that industry.

Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at:

* We‚Äôre building an MVP using a smaller, manually created dataset to test the approach and gather feedback from trusted industry contacts.
* I have a solid understanding of the industry and its need for such a tool, while my partner (a programmer) has brought my idea to life technically.
* The large database that could truly unlock the tool‚Äôs potential is owned by a large nonprofit organisation.

Our main concern is figuring out how to approach this organisation. Neither of us has experience negotiating data access agreements, and we worry they might see our idea and develop their own solution.

One alternative we‚Äôve considered is starting with a similar, smaller organisation to test the tool with a live dataset and later approach the larger organisation with evidence of our tool's usefulness. However, this raises concerns:

1. The smaller market and less sophisticated user base may not fully benefit from the tool, limiting our proof of concept.
2. We risk someone else replicating the idea with the larger organisation while we focus on the smaller one, potentially losing our competitive edge.

I‚Äôd appreciate advice from anyone with experience negotiating data access agreements or navigating similar situations. What factors should we consider, and how can we protect our idea while forging partnerships?

Looking forward to your insights.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old non-technical CEO of a tech startup in the textile industry. My journey began about 5-6 months ago when I built an MVP(3 months ago) on Bubble.io. Despite being a no-code platform, it helped me attract 80+ users within a 2km radius, and I‚Äôve even seen some organic growth. Recently, I found a tech co-founder who‚Äôs now rebuilding the product with proper coding, as Bubble has its limitations for the features we need. Along the way, I also onboarded a CMO (a close friend) during my marketing efforts.

Here‚Äôs where I need advice:

Before starting this, I owned a textile manufacturing unit and made a decent living. But since diving into the startup, I‚Äôve struggled to balance both worlds. Recently, I closed down the manufacturing business because the building owner rented the space to someone else. Now I‚Äôm all-in on the startup, but it‚Äôs not generating enough revenue to support me yet.

My family (especially my dad) wants me to return to manufacturing to make a living until the startup becomes viable. They‚Äôre hesitant about me investing personal funds (up to 50 lakhs INR) into the startup, even though I believe in its potential. On the other hand, I keep hearing advice to bootstrap for as long as possible and avoid diluting equity early on.

So, I‚Äôm at a crossroads:

1. Should I restart manufacturing on the side to stay afloat while slowly building the startup?

2. Should I try to convince my family and invest personal funds?

3. Or should I dilute equity and raise external funding now to fully focus on the startup?

I‚Äôd love to hear from fellow founders, especially those who‚Äôve faced similar situations. How did you balance financial stability with chasing your startup dream?

It felt like there were two paths: either jumping on the entrepreneur path that was all over Instagram, or being the ""good kid"" heading to university.

I thought... screw it, why pick? Started working on a startup while doing uni.

First startup? Complete flop. But hey, failed fast and tried again. Second time was different - built an AI Web Design platform by myself and somehow managed to grow it to 8k users in just 3 months. Ended up selling it for $12k. Not life-changing money for most people here, but for an 18-year-old who had never seen more than a few hundred bucks? Mind-blowing.

That exit opened some crazy doors. Now I'm working at another startup that's like my old one on steroids in a team of 20 absolute killers.

Best part? All doors are open. Could start another company, keep learning from my current team, or jump to something new. Sky's the limit. (but for now I'm definitely staying where I am)

TL;DR: Your life can change so incredibly much in a few months it's crazy

A bit of context first. I have a small community development agency. Started this way back 2019. Had a bunch of clients during the WEB 3 surge, where projects needed a community manager or a team to handle their community. Been a solid run till Q4 of 2022. Never needed to do outbound because of the early connections I've made, we did a solid job and got clients solely from referrals. Started with a 3 man team, went all the way to 48 contractual team members, down to 24. Right now, I basically have access to 24 team members waiting for tasks, because we have no clients. At the same time, I'm trying to penetrate the social media industry since social medias are also communities.

To add to that, one of my longest client who turned into a good friend, stole my idea of a tool that helps communities thrive online. Since he's more liquid to develop such tools, he went at it and made his own.

Do you have tips on how to establish a good system for generating leads? From where I am, cost of living is not expensive, and I'll be more than happy to make consistent monthly gains rather than 1 big lump sum.

The new tax rules in the U.S. (like Section 174) make things harder for startups. You now have to pay taxes on money that was spent on engineers, even if you don‚Äôt have profits yet. That‚Äôs unfair for people trying to build something new.

I'm an architect, 3D artist, and AI enthusiast based in Hungary with a vision to create innovative tools for the architecture and 3D art industries. I've already started a project aimed at enhancing workflows for professionals in these fields. While there are many tools out there, the quality and efficiency of my workflows offer a significant advantage.

i have deep industry knowledge, clear vision for growth and marketing strategies. I've attached my website and project screenshots also so you know i am really pushing hard i work full time but i work on my side projects on weekends and after working hours .

My skills :

1-3d art /architecture/music production (expert)

2-Comfyui /AI workflows (expert)

3-webdesign (i can build any website not an expert but good as you can see)

4-sales and marketing (Learning and my main goal is to be one of the best marketers that's why i need some one with me i have lots of creative project ideas and i think if you are persistent enough we can go big either in the AI space or the XR space or both there is lots of opportunities right now)

5- Programming (beginner i started this project 4-5 months ago i used a purepython framework but i think it can do the job if we can deliver the mvp , do sales marketing and then if it goes big we can do it in next.js it seemed easy to me and we can use the existing code as fastapi end points already)

mvp wip screenshots : this is working locally right now but i think the main structure is set already i need someone who can deliver this to the cloud also and make it work seamlessly there are some minor bugs in the ui but it can be solved easily:

i will post thin in comments

what i want from you :

1-be able to assemble general saas functions (payment , docker , databse etc) , and basically do everything technically i will be with you so you can tell me what to do as i am a beginner but i can help ,at the end i will be responsible for sales marketing and content etc i will just be with you as a helping hand to deliver very fast..

They are much bigger than my solution but I still offer a better service for the problem that I was focused on from the start. It‚Äôs tough to gauge whether they are profitable or simply burning cash to outlast smaller players. I‚Äôm uncertain whether I should start investing in paid marketing to accelerate growth or continue focusing on organic expansion. My concern is that they could overpower me soon, though this is more of a gut feeling than something I can quantify with data. What are your thoughts? I feel cornered either way as they are positioned much better to paid marketing growth.

One day, while sitting in my car, I came up with an idea for a product that, as far as I know, hasn't been created yet. However, there are significant barriers to bringing it to life, the biggest one being my lack of the required skillset.

To make this product, l'd need to know how to code-or find someone who does and know how to build electronics. This made me wonder: how can I turn this idea into reality if I don't have the skills to create it myself? And if I do find someone with the necessary expertise, what's to stop them from taking my idea and developing it themselves?

67558dc7eeb7770cf0a37e50,1gsgavi,Why don't VCs just allow founders to pay themselves &gt;= $300k so startups are more competitive with MAANG?,"For as long as I can remember VCs have argued that they want to pay founders a lower salary for two main reasons:

- They want the founders focused on long term value of the startup, not the salary.

- They want more of the investment to go into growing the company.

However, I think the issue now is that MAANG is paying &gt;= $500k total comp and since your RSUs are liquid you can exercise often.

This locks up a LOT of talent in MAANG companies.

Additionally, it doesn't align the investors to the founders.

Most investors are either independently wealthy (from a previous exit) or are getting nice compensation from the VC firm.

There's no alignment there.

Couldn't you make the same argument from the VCs?  That the founders should force the investors to live on a small amount of money so that THEY are also incentivized for the long term?

I mean obviously that would never happen.

I think this is kind of changing for for AI startups where they can pay just massive salaries because AI talent is scarce.

It's working too. There's a lot of innovation in AI right now.

So what's the holdup here?  It's not super exciting to me to walk away from a nice and comfortable position at MAANG to take a risky job that pays less money.",184,startups,1731734738.0,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gsgavi/why_dont_vcs_just_allow_founders_to_pay/,question

I had just happened to have a convo with an angel/mentor scheduled today. 100% coincidence, btw. They said I‚Äôd I can get it to 1,000 users or $1,000+ then to come back and they might toss me some $ to help fund it.

We‚Äôre living in the age of AI, and while it‚Äôs revolutionizing industries like healthcare and B2B finance, I can‚Äôt help but wonder: why isn‚Äôt anyone building AI tools for the everyday consumers, especially when it comes to managing our personal finances? ü§î

Why not a smart, personalized AI that connects securely to your financial data (your credit cards, bank accounts, etc.) and becomes your go-to financial assistant. You could ask it *anything*, like:

* **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best credit card for my dining expenses?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúHow much can I safely spend this month without touching my savings?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the quickest way to pay off my debt while maximizing my rewards?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúWhich insurance plan aligns with my lifestyle?‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúAm I saving enough to buy my dream home in 5 years?‚Äù**

A NON JUDGEMENTAL FINANCIAL advisor available 24/7 who tailors advice *just for you*.

Here‚Äôs why I think this idea is exciting:

1. **AI + Your Data = Personalized Insights**: Instead of generic advice, it gives you actionable tips based on your actual spending, saving, and investment patterns.
2. **Empowering Decision-Making**: Whether you‚Äôre picking the best accounts, optimizing rewards, or planning for the future, it makes everything simpler and clearer.
3. **Bridging the Gap**: AI is thriving in B2B, but the consumer sector is being overlooked. Why not bring this game-changing tech directly to individuals?

First-time technical founder here. Two years ago, I decided to leave the 9-5 grind and build something meaningful. Now, I have (what I believe is) a brilliant technical solution but no clear business case. I‚Äôm seeking a cofounder with product and marketing expertise to help pivot my project into a viable business - or start a new one. Details below.

**About Me**

* 36yo, born in Berlin and moved to San Francisco 8 years ago
* Master's in Software Engineering with 15 years of experience
* Worked with early-stage startups in Berlin and a venture studio in SF
* Spent the past years leading a team of 12 shipping enterprise software 

**The tech I've built**

An AI engine that makes it easy for developers to automate their workflows. It works with code, issues, PRs and integrates with 3rd party systems like error trackers, wikis, ticketing systems, etc. It takes natural language instructions, fulfills them autonomously and responds with a result. The functionality is served as a platform, with an API and an SDK. On top of it, I've built a CLI and a web application with productivity tools for developers.

**Who and what I'm looking for**

My main goal is to leave my current job and build a company around a problem that matters to me, ideally with considerable equity. I‚Äôm looking for:

* **A cofounder** with product and marketing expertise who sees potential in my tech and can help turn it into a successful business‚Äîor someone with a strong business case who needs a technical founder.
* **Mentorship** from someone experienced in dev tool startups or as a successful solo founder. I‚Äôd love to learn from your journey and would be happy to offer my technical expertise or collaborate on projects in return.

It would be great if you could please help me out with the below. 

We‚Äôre currently scaling an AI-driven solution that‚Äôs already serving clients. We‚Äôre looking for the best platform or tech stack to take our system to the next level, ensuring **simplicity, scalability, and affordability**. We are focussed on smaller business that don't have a big budget, loads of time or their own technical team; we want to provide an almost plug and play solution for these businesses.

üîç **What We've Built**: We‚Äôve developed a suite of over **100+ AI assistants** that leverage **core documents** (like business overviews) to tailor their functionality to each client. Our goal is to provide **ChatGPT-style interactions** where users can chat with AI agents that dynamically pull in data from these core documents and other documents, improving workflows across departments like marketing, HR, finance, and sales.

üõ† **Current Use Cases**: Here‚Äôs how some our interconnected AI assistants collaborate to streamline business operations:

1. **Researcher + Sales Guru + Sales Assistant + Executive Assistant**:
   * Conducts deep research, consults the Sales Guru to create a strategy, passes it to the Sales Assistant to generate sales collateral and outreach cadence, and uses the Executive Assistant to coordinate internal team communications.
2. **Report Creator/Data Analyst + Business Guru + Marketing Guru + Marketing Planner + Content Creator**:
   * Reviews customer engagement surveys, extracts insights, develops a marketing strategy, creates a detailed plan, and produces targeted content.
3. **Marketing KPI Reviewer + Advisor + Planner + Content Creator**:
   * Analyses performance metrics, offers strategic advice, builds marketing plans, and generates relevant content to address key challenges.

üí° **What We‚Äôre Looking For**: We‚Äôre searching for a tech stack or platform that can:

1. **Provide ChatGPT-style user interactions** with AI agents that can dynamically pull and utilise data from client-specific documents.
2. **Scale efficiently** to handle multiple clients while ensuring robust data security and protecting our IP.
3. Enable seamless **interconnected workflows** among different AI assistants, optimising collaboration across departments.

üîß **Current Setup**: We‚Äôve been using a custom setup with ChatGPT Pro and file integration (uploaded files) for our initial deployments. However, we need something more robust and scalable to handle a growing client base with more sophisticated requirements.

Any advice on tech stacks, platforms, or frameworks that can meet these needs? We‚Äôre considering solutions that combine ease of use with powerful capabilities to scale efficiently without breaking the bank. At the moment the current set up takes too long to edit assistants or core document as they are held per customer and on each assistant etc.

Sometimes it means that I can work till the night. Always work on evenings, weekends, and every day. Only because I want it, my family needs it, and because it is who I am. Yeah, sure, 9-5 pay the bills right now.

But my side hustle is the future. I get up on the weekends without alarms and just enjoy working on my thing. Especially when my business makes money, it feels great. It gives more power, freedom, and joy.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP is also hard. Because you literally can build things without knowing will be you paid for that. Or is it the right thing to do ? A lot of doubts, sleepless nights in my mind. One thing is for sure: it is all worth it. Yeah, you have a big chance to get nothing in the end.

But one thing you won't regret is that you did it. It is hard to predict whether it is your success or not. Is it your thing or not?

One thing I know for sure, more you try, more chances you get. Because all we need is 1 win from 100 attempts. One win will change your life fully. You won't be the same.

The service will focus on protecting data-in-use, accessible via an API, requiring no cryptography expertise or modifications to client-side processes.

At this stage, I‚Äôve finalized my pitch for a seed funding round but am working on addressing the last remaining gaps. The biggest challenge I‚Äôm facing is estimating the total addressable market size. I‚Äôm struggling because I lack a clear sense of how to quantify such a broad and potentially vast market.

One clear example of an addressable market is the online survey industry, where I‚Äôve already connected with some local players. Current data indicates this market will be valued at approximately **$1.35 billion in 2024**.

Another major market is the EU financial sector, which is regulated under DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act). According to the EBA (European Banking Authority), the EU banking sector alone‚Äîpart of the market impacted by DORA‚Äîhad **‚Ç¨30.7 trillion in assets as of 2022**. I also have close contacts in this sector and have verified that there‚Äôs clear demand for the type of service I‚Äôm planning to establish.

Here‚Äôs my question: do I simply sum up these figures and use that total as an estimate of the overall market size? Or is there a better, more accurate way to approach this?

Obviously, there are many more potential markets to consider, and it feels like an endless search. How do I know when I have gathered enough numbers or reached a reasonable estimate? Eventually, it is important to denote that i'm explicitly not targeting the Machine-Learning Market in the beginning, because efficiency there cannot be guaranteed in general.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e6c,1grrb1f,I thought I‚Äôd share a few things that might cheer you up.,"After graduating from college, my two best friends and I started a service-based startup. We have developed many websites, mobile apps, and AI projects to help companies solve their customer-related problems.

From the beginning, instead of just solving others‚Äô problems, we wanted to work on something that truly mattered to us. We tried a lot of different ideas, but none of them took off. After a series of failures, we were fortunate enough to realize that every successful entrepreneur has something in common: the problems they solve are personal to them. I‚Äôm not saying this applies to everyone, but when you deeply analyze, you could see something.

EX : Shopify 
Tobias L√ºtke wanted to sell snowboarding gear online but was frustrated with the existing e-commerce solutions. So, he built Shopify to solve his own problem. Soon, others facing the same challenges started using Shopify, and that‚Äôs how it turned into a successful business.

Ex: Google
There were 5 search engines before Google. None of them were addressing the key problems of the users. The average query takes around 2-3 hours and showing totally irrelevant results. So Sergey and Larry both faced the same problem and wanted to come up with a solution. Initially, they built it for them. After some time many people have started using it. That‚Äôs the birth of Google. 

Ex: Facebook 
Facebook‚Äôs initial idea was to create an online directory for Harvard students, allowing them to connect and share information. Mark Zuckerberg was inspired by the existing concept of ‚Äúface books,‚Äù paper directories featuring student photos and basic details. He might have stopped if this project hadn‚Äôt been personal to him.

Ex: Stripe 
Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison. The idea came from their own frustrations with existing payment systems while building online businesses. They created a simple payment gateway that could be easily integrated into businesses without extensive setup or high fees. This, too, was a personal solution to a problem they faced.

There are countless examples like this, and the most exciting part is that we‚Äôre following the same path as these successful entrepreneurs took. 

The problem we faced was the lack of a reliable source for timely content outside of social media. But, social media has become increasingly toxic, filled with fake news, misinformation, and manipulated content. Also, there‚Äôs no way to dive deeper, extract more details, or effectively fact-check. Content aggregators that provide timely updates are overloaded with long-form content and  it‚Äôs impossible to get quick coverage within seconds.

So, we developed an app just for ourselves that satisfies  our needs. When my friends saw me using it, they wanted to download it too. That‚Äôs when we realized others might be facing the same problem. We invited friends to try it out, and, to our surprise, the app quickly grew to over 1,000 users, with 70% retention. We continued improving it, and now, the average daily time spent on the app is around 12-15 minutes. I know 1,000 users isn‚Äôt huge, but we‚Äôve built something that truly matters to us and others. 

I hope there is a strong potential so we started working on it full-time. We‚Äôre still in the early stages, but we‚Äôre seeing organic growth of around 10% per week.

Basically the message I wanted to convey you all was, build something that truly matters you first. The more personal it is the higher your chances of success.",2,startups,1731656809.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1grrb1f/i_thought_id_share_a_few_things_that_might_cheer/,experience

The first acquisition offer was like 3-4 years in and was for like $750k. I didn't take it as I thought the company was worth more.

The next acquisition offer was like 8 years in.  It was for like $4M but then when I went in for the very last meeting they wanted to low ball me at like $840k or something.

Honestly, I thought the whole thing was shady so I just walked out.

The last one I actually approached one of our major customers and asked them to acquire us - which they eventually ended up doing for 7 figures.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e79,1grgl4i,"Launched 3 Hours Ago and Already Got 2,641 Signups for Our SaaS Product (That Isn‚Äôt Even Out Yet!)","Hi everyone,

After months of intense work, our team finally launched the waitlist for our AI-powered no-code SaaS product. The goal? To create something truly competitive and unique in the market. It‚Äôs been a whirlwind of design, development, and perfecting every detail to bring something fresh and impactful. Here‚Äôs the story of how we got to 2,641 signups in just three hours!

**The Journey: Months of Prep**  
  
We‚Äôve spent countless hours developing an MVP that would genuinely bring a competitive edge. The plan was to release it officially later this week, but we wanted to get an early pool of excited adopters on board. So, we decided to launch a simple landing page with a waitlist‚Äîjust something to build some initial interest from the right people.

But to make sure our product grabbed attention, we needed something that would show its value *fast*. That‚Äôs where our 29-second video demo came in - showcasing our main value proposition.

**The Key Move: A super-short, 29-Second Video Demo**  
  
To convey how easy and powerful our product is, we put together a super short, 29-second video showing off the happy path of using it.

Every second was crafted carefully, we obsessed over every frame in Adobe Premiere Pro, making sure it perfectly demonstrated how our solution simplifies things compared to existing options. Our goal was to show, not tell.

With the landing page and the video demo ready, we finally launched our waitlist three hours ago.

**The Unexpected Surge: 2,641 Signups in 3 Hours**  
After publishing a few posts across relevant subreddits, we saw some nice engagement, and then‚Ä¶ it took off. A few posts started gaining serious traction.

Now, just three hours after going live, **we have 2,641 signups**, and our Slack channel is flooded with notifications of new subscribers. We weren‚Äôt expecting this kind of response, and it‚Äôs amazing to see people are genuinely interested in what we‚Äôre building‚Äîeven before the full launch.  
  
**Why We Think It Worked**

* **Focus on the core value:** Instead of listing features, we showed exactly how our product solves a real pain point
* **Short but powerful demo:** 29 seconds was just enough to showcase the magic without losing attention
* **Right timing:** We hit the sweet spot between validation and launch, creating urgency

  
**What's next...?**  
  
As excited as we are, we know the signups will eventually slow down. The obvious next step is to launch the product itself and get our users happy (which we will - number one goal!). But I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdoes anyone here have any advice for keeping the excitement going even after these initial posts lose visibility?

I‚Äôm thinking of ways to extend the momentum, maybe with some creative strategies or ideas to keep the buzz alive until the product officially launches.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e81,1gr8w16,Health Care Tech promotion needs a nuanced approach,"Hello

We are a health care tech start up with a small team and modest budget. We built a solid app currently in an open access phase for testing and feedback. 

We have gotten 15 user signups just by word of mouth / social media posts. One user has reported positive experience and plans to continue using the platform after open access.

I have expertise in the health field as a provider. So I know how tricky it is to sell a product to health care providers. We are a skeptical bunch. Often new technology is hoisted upon us by organizational leadership. It‚Äôs rarely a self-motivated choice. 

Further, providers in my field in general tend to protect their networks and avoid solicitors and solicitation like the plague. 

I‚Äôm wondering how to approach a nuanced market. High level question is should I find an expert with this and pay them to help? We don‚Äôt have a lot of cash so it would be a significant risk to do so. 

On the other hand we aren‚Äôt opposed to bootstrapping as we have been doing but I worry about a lack of nuanced strategy damaging our brand. 

Any advice particularly in the health field would be welcomed!

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e85,1gr2hld,How to start online business in 7 days ? ,"Easy to do now. There are several tips that I can give you to start your own digital business.

1) Solve your own problem. If you use the Internet, you know that there are a lot of problems that need to be solved. But focus on your problem first. Once you can figure it out and solve your problem. You can move on to solving people's problems. Ideally, to use tools and technology you know. If you don't know, use NO-CODE tools to build it. For example, if you need to create a website, use landing page builder. If you want to automate your own work, like booking meetings, use Zapier to automate tasks. If you want to create a game, sure, use AI Tools to solve it.  
  
I don't care what you will use. Use whatever you want. All I want from you is to solve that problem.  
  
2) After solving your own problem. You can focus on people's problems. Because if you can't solve your own shit, why do you want to solve others problems? Remember that always.  
  
If you need to build e-commerce, use Shopify. If you need to build a directory, use directory builder. If you need to build landing pages, use landing page builders.  
  
Rule of thumb: Niche, Niche, Niche. Try to focus on a specific niche, solve their problem, and make money on it. Then only thinking about exploring new opportunities.

You can use No-Code builders or AI tools or hire developers or hire agencies to do it. It depends on your choice. If you are good at coding, build on your own or delegate to a developer or agency. If you have enough time, use AI Tools to build your own thing. If you want to solve a common problem but with a different perspective, yeah, sure, use No-Code builders for that.  
  
3) Digital business works exactly the same as offline business with one difference. You can move a lot faster, build a lot faster, risk a lot faster, fail a lot faster, earn a lot faster, sell a lot faster, and scale a lot faster.  
  
In one week, you can build e-commerce. In the second week, you can build SaaS. In the third week, you can build an AI agent. In the fourth week, you can build your own channel on social media.

4) It gives more power. With great power comes great responsibility. From day one, invest in SEO, social media presence, traffic, and acquiring customers.

Don't focus on tech stuff. Don't focus on tools.

Focus on the real problem:

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e8b,1gqw5so,"$7.5 L12, Lean, Profitable, Raising with Legacy Debt","Hey Reddit Community,

I‚Äôm seeking advice on how to get investors to engage and respond as we work to raise $2M to fuel our next phase of growth. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our business and where we currently stand:

About Us:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre a D2C e-commerce dropshipping business focused on tech and scalability with a patent-pending platform. We operate with a lean model‚Äîno inventory risk, just pure tech enablement.
	‚Ä¢	Historically, we‚Äôve achieved $75M in sales, and after pivoting away from an old Amazon-dependent model, we‚Äôre now selling exclusively on our own website.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre currently generating $450K/month in revenue with 32.5% gross margins. We‚Äôve hit 6 consecutive months of profitability and are continuing to grow.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve served over 160,000 customers, with an average order value of $175, and have garnered over 18,000 positive customer reviews.

What We‚Äôre Looking to Do:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre aiming to raise $2M through either a growth investor or a convertible note to accelerate our growth and scale further.
	‚Ä¢	The capital will allow us to optimize our existing debt and improve our cash flow, positioning us for faster growth and a potential larger equity round in the near future.

The Obstacle:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre currently optimizing about $1.75M in legacy debt, which costs us around $20K/month in legal fees, principal, interest, and debt settlements.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve made significant strides, including settling a $2M supplier debt down to $800K, and restructuring payments with other financial partners to ease cash flow.
	‚Ä¢	However, we‚Äôre hitting a wall‚Äîmany investors see us as either too big for seed funding or too small for growth capital. This makes it challenging to get responses, even though we‚Äôre profitable and growing.

Looking for Advice:

	1.	How can we optimize our outreach to get responses from growth investors or convertible note providers? What strategies have worked for you in getting their attention?
	2.	Are there specific firms, family offices, or investors that focus on companies in our stage‚Äîprofitable but still scaling?
	3.	What are the best channels for outreach (cold emails, LinkedIn, warm intros, etc.)? Any tips on structuring these messages to increase engagement?

We‚Äôre confident in the strength of our business model and the growth potential of our current pivot, but we‚Äôre having trouble getting in front of the right investors who can see the value we‚Äôre bringing.

I'm getting ready to start designing our MVP in Figma (non-technical co-founder). I'm getting some conflicting answers as to whether we should design (in Figma) entirely from scratch (which would be free), or if it's better to go with an established library (i.e., MUI, Ant Design, etc).

If we build it from scratch, we have greater control. But that would take up a lot of time and it would push our launch way out. If we go with paying for a UI kit/library, I'm worried that it may ""look like other products"" or that ""it's not innovative enough"". I also just don't know how common paying for a library is for startups (and companies in general), and if that would impact how potential investors view us.

One advice I got was to use an established design system/library so we can focus our time on getting the product out as quickly as possible - because at the end of the data, having real users using the product is most important.

My co-founder is my boyfriend, who is skilled in design, legal matters, and negotiation. This was one of the main reasons I started the company with him.

In the beginning, everything was running smoothly for the first 1-2 months. However, he then mentioned that he had upcoming college exams and couldn‚Äôt contribute for two weeks. I understood and managed the workload on my own. But now, it has been four months, and he hasn‚Äôt taken any significant initiatives or contributed to the work.

For the past three months, I have been asking him to open the company bank account, but it hasn‚Äôt been done. Although I lacked design skills, I redesigned the website by myself. He hasn‚Äôt helped generate leads or reached out to potential clients. Apart from setting up the initial base of the site in the first two months, he hasn‚Äôt made any further contributions.

I took on cold calling and cold messaging 30-50 people daily for an entire month, which led to securing 64 wedding opportunities. This industry is untapped, and some industry insiders even found our idea unusual and responded rudely. After his initial negative experience with a call, he refused to reach out to anyone again. (his communication is way better than me, and it was a challenge to deal with people on call)

Now, we need to redo much of the work, ifor finding foreigners. However, I have an important exam coming up in 10 days, which is imp for me. I‚Äôve been asking him to take the initiative and shoulder some responsibilities, but he responds me saying that I only care about work and often argues with me. Despite balancing our personal relationship with dates and celebrations, I end up doing all the work to avoid conflicts and maintain our relationship.

It‚Äôs challenging to manage both my studies and the startup, especially since our idea is unconventional. I feel torn because if I don‚Äôt continue working hard, the past few months‚Äô efforts will be wasted.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e9a,1gqba0e,Had to close my profit making agency due to lack of a Sales Cofounder,"I am a technical founder and love building tech. I started my first project when I was 18 from my college dorm, that project got selected to some of the best tech universities and got mentoring and networking from there.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e9e,1gqami4,How to boost visitors to websites ?,"I am not an expert or something, will share only practical tips that work for me.

Firstly, I will share details about me. I am a bootstrap founder, meaning that I don't spend money on marketing or sales. Because I don't have money for that right now, and trying to use all ways to maximize my efforts.

People really want simple things that solve their problems. Because of that you don't need to sell them something, but what they really need is to see that your solution can help them. You can do it in different ways, beginning with targeting ads or setting up Google Ads. But it will be another story.

Let's start.

1) Understand where hanging out your ideal customer is. For my cases it is X, Reddit, and LinkedIn. You need to start posting content related to your niche and product. In the beginning, focus on niche as long as you can. Because all you need is to understand their problems and improve on each request.

2) Give your perfect customer a free trial or free usage. Don't ask anything upfront. Just give them and be around. If they have any questions or ideas, write them down immediately. Try to document everything they say. You can analyze it later. After giving free usage or a free trial. Write them a personalized email or message, could they give feedback or review (ONLY AFTER USING YOUR APP, AND AUTHORIZATION). If they don't want to give, no problem, don't do anything, don't be rude, don't take away his/her usage. LET IT BE. A lot of people, especially in the beginning who are ready to give their time to your product, will be your best friends. All you really need to do is ask. 80% of them will give you what you want.

3) After understanding your ideal customer and getting at least 50-100 ideas/reviews/feedback from free users, you need to find general and common problems. Take them and work, work, work on it. After getting it done. Go to the next step.

4) You are ready to launch. Submit to directories as your product category. Write SEO articles from day one based on your website content (do it each day). If there is a need for free tools on the same topic as you do, you need to build them under different pages. For example, if you do wealth planning, it is good to have a wealth calculator. Don't build it blindly. Go to Google Keywords and analyze trends and keywords that people are searching for. It is your juicy traffic.

5) If you are doing B2B business, you need to generate a lot of cold emails. If you are doing B2C, you need to generate a lot of short videos on Youtube, TikTok, and Instagram, and ideally to generate content on platforms like Reddit and X.",0,startups,1731496675.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gqami4/how_to_boost_visitors_to_websites/,experience
67558dcceeb7770cf0a37e9f,1gq7y84,Pre-seed burning questions (UK based),"First time solo founder here, based in the UK. I‚Äôm looking to know a little more about raising pre-seed.
(I‚Äôm aware my startup is still a long way off this, but just out of curiosity I have a few questions).

When raising pre-seed, how much is expected to be factored in for my salary? I understand that founders should pay themselves minimum, but if I have committed to certain expenses e.g mortgage/kids, then I will need to have that covered - and if I earn around ¬£96k then would I ask that as a salary? 

What if I want to add another co-founder on board and they‚Äôre in a similar position? 

A comfortable salary would allow us to work on the startup 100% with no distractions, so would a VC firm prefer this?

Currently I am working full time - but after raising the pre-seed, how much time would I have to quite my job? I‚Äôm assuming this is something that can be negotiated.

Or could I go down to working part-time say 2 days a week, and then pay myself less salary from pre-seed?

How are funds distributed? Say I have asked for ¬£500k is that deposited in one lump sump into a business account, or would the company receive a certain amount of funding per month for 12 months?

Is there much flexibility on how funds can be spent, say I initially was spending 40% on product development, is there enough autonomy to raise this to 50% if needed?

Is it expected with pre-seed to have a runway of around 12-18 months ? Or can you spend pre-seed money like bootstrapping and spend only as needed ?

Terms I‚Äôm assuming vary, but generally looking at between 10-20% equity for VC? Are there any terms that generally get included in pre-seed contracts, like certain milestones to be met, before raising another round?

I believe in working hard towards something in the short-term to reap its benefits in the long term. It‚Äôs very tough for me to stay in one spot, my mind is always wandering and never really stops working.

67558dcceeb7770cf0a37ea5,1gq1dpy,How to know if your cofounder isn't pulling their weight?,"I've been working on a startup as a technical founder focused on product initially. I reached out and tried recruiting cofounders but didn't find the right fit until around April when I met a potential CTO/technical founder. We hit it off and he got involved and helped orchestrate some of our architecture, CI/CD, testing and authentication systems.

This was a big relief off my shoulders and helped focus more on the core product. Along the way I've collaborated with his responsibility areas to help him better integrate with our systems. But I knew his time and ability to contribute was limited to part-time. However initially I was pretty happy with his contributions. 

However lately I've realized the pace of his progress is stagnating or almost non-existent. I'm growing to question whether I should continue or just confront him to step up or step aside.

I expect some ups and downs but we have to consistently make significant progress on a monthly basis to get anywhere. I know if I keep looking I might find someone else and if I don't, I can be a solo founder. 

I guess I'm looking more for feedback or other people's experiences trying to work with other cofounders. My goal is to eventually split equity with him equally but we don't have any customers, just a product and we're bootstrapping with our own free time. 

How long of a grace period should you give a cofounder for issues? I'm not feeling any pressure right now since I've got time to get the product right. However I recently went to a convention and I'm eager to get our product stable and deployed so I can focus on selling it and delegate the management of operations/infrastructure to the cofounder or hire staff. 

I've already been working with my cousin also who is consulting as a developer and I realize she could largely shoulder many of his burdens if needed. She's familiar with the code and I could take over some of the cofounders roles until systems are mature and then delegate the maintenance and operations to her and hire more help as we get customers.",11,startups,1731461449.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gq1dpy/how_to_know_if_your_cofounder_isnt_pulling_their/,question

So far, we're bootstrapped and received federal funding for seed/series A type activities and now have a validated product with distinct advantages over the competition, and an eager target market.  Now we're needing revenue growth/series B capital.  No equity dilution or bonds to date.

However, it recently dawned on me that we will soon need a way to accept payments which to me means we need a business bank account which means we need to establish a business entity to make that account and therefore we have to establish the terms of our partnership.

That where I‚Äôm at right now and I have two questions: 

1. I already have a business bank account for a personal LLC of mine, would that be adequate to accept payments? Only issue is then I technically own all of the income since my partner is not on it.

2. If it is time to establish a shared business entity, how do you outline the terms of that? Obviously we want to protect each other in the event that someone wants to (or ought to) leave, but we wouldn‚Äôt want that individual walking away with half the business in their pocket. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm exploring the topic of founder vesting, but are there other options? 

We have a lot of trust in our relationship so potentially I could do everything through my personal LLC and eventually when we have the means to get lawyers and make a real contract I would just sign over the assets of my personal LLC to where it rightfully belongs in our joint venture. Maybe that‚Äôs something we should put in writing for the meantime. It‚Äôs hard to think that we should do all of this legal stuff before our first sale but I‚Äôd like to keep the mode of payment professional for the sake of the customer. 

Any advice on this is much appreciated!",0,startups,1731430156.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gpp7cp/how_do_cofounders_establish_ownership_in_early/,question

While these tactics may bring short-term results, they rarely build sustainable growth. Here‚Äôs why they hurt your brand and what to do instead.

# 1. Cheap Traffic Won‚Äôt Convert

Buying traffic or using clickbait might bring visitors, but they rarely turn into paying customers. Focus on attracting *qualified* leads who genuinely care about your offer.

# 2. SEO Shortcuts Aren‚Äôt Sustainable

Keyword stuffing and black-hat tactics might get you rankings temporarily, but they‚Äôll hurt your site long-term. Real SEO requires high-quality content, optimization, and relevant backlinks.

# 3. Over-Promoting on Social Media Turns Off Audiences

Social media should build relationships, not just promote products. Share valuable content, engage with your audience, and offer insights that build loyalty.

# 4. Google Ads Without Strategy Waste Money

Google Ads can burn through your budget if you don‚Äôt have a clear strategy. Focus on precise targeting and continuous optimization to get the best ROI.

# 5. Consistency is Key

Quick fixes lead to inconsistent messaging, confusing your audience. Stay consistent with your brand message and focus on solving your customers‚Äô problems.

# What Should You Do Instead?

* **Be Strategic**: Develop a marketing strategy with long-term goals.
* **Provide Real Value**: Deliver value through your content and service.
* **Track and Optimize**: Continuously measure and adjust your campaigns.

# Final Thought

Quick fixes may give temporary results, but true success comes from consistent, long-term strategies. Build relationships, offer real value, and focus on long-term growth.

My previous 3 startups have been successful and I was able to start and scale them 100% with customer money. The first 2 I shut down due to industry changes. The 3rd was very successful until February of this year. All 3 of those startups where the same concept but catering to seperate industries. (Typically trending industries). 

My biggest mistakes are the business partners I have selected. Basically I end up with 80-90% of the workload and the other person just seems to hangout. It has been hard to find someone with the same motivation as myself to grow the startups, putting in 70-80 hour weeks.

\- Build it myself either on Bubble or with AI assistance (while I'm ok at coding and bubble, I'm not a developer so I could send myself insane doing this).  
\- Get a developer to build it (I have some quotes around the $10k mark).

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ecd,1goljw6,Easy to use tools to make a clickable prototype,"Hi all,

I have an idea for a website and would like to make a clickable prototype. Mainly to validate and to show people my idea (it is considered quite abstract for those not in the niche field so will make it easier to explain).  

What is the best way to do this? 

I have not created a website in years so am essentially a complete beginner and so would like to use a website builder that is drag and drop and easy to make it look pretty.  

It will have a giant menu and I need to be able to change the menu (add/remove subsections) easily. I also need to be able to add in a clickable map that has an action once clicked, and the option to add and export PowerPoint files and Excel files.  

I was thinking of using Elementor Pro to build it mainly because it looks relatively easy (although I have zero experience with it) and has the map plugin and mega menu plugin.  

The website will be built from scratch at a later date, this clickable prototype is only for explaining and validating with potential users.

Anyone got any other recommendations?  

Thanks in advance!

I came up with a potential solution...Today, I created a landing page to gauge interest and filmed a video with a local fitness instructor (it's on the site)

**Potential Problem:** Employee wellness programs often include gym memberships and other out-of-office benefits. While it's great for some employees, it's ignoring a large portion of the workforce who isn't interested in dedicating the time to go to the gym, has kids and can't, etc.  
  
**My Idea:** OffiHealth is an online platform that produces bite-sized guided videos such as stretching, exercises, and meditations. These videos are 10 minutes long; everything can be done in a small office space.

**Why employers should care:** Studies have shown that workplace wellness programs can significantly impact employee productivity, job satisfaction, and overall health. A Harvard Business Review study found that mindfulness meditation can increase focus and productivity by up to 40%. Additionally, research from the Mayo Clinic indicates that regular exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mental health, and reduce absenteeism.

(FE &amp; BE/prompt),"Hi everyone, posting this question for my very talented entrepreneur friend, u/Cloud_Dev_Env, who's looking for advice on early-stage bootstrapping. I asked him to elaborate on his business idea to help identify best solutions. In his words: 

\------

Hi all, I'm trying to figure out how to recruit talented folks pre-funding.

We're two founders looking to streamline engineering ops and help teams meet milestones by building a reconciliation engine across Slack, Jira, Zoom, Github and more. Engineering leaders and managers spend hours on 1-on-1s , dailies , yet fire-drills are a constant part of their day. Developers are stuck or blocked, scope creep, PRs are pending too long and miscommunication are some of the reasons for that. We believe the data is there and we want to extract its meaning and make it accessible.¬†

Lots of LLMs, working with embeddings and vectors. Super interesting and lots of opportunities to learn and contribute.¬†

We interviewed 100 prospective users (engineering leaders) just with our rough first draft and already had several clear notices of interest. Our CTO is amazing (VP Eng himself) but we don't feel like we're moving fast enough on the MVP. It‚Äôs a big challenge for just one person.¬†

We thought it would be better to have at least one frontend engineer (big gap between our Figma and the functionality as well as current UI) and another backend or prompt engineer to help make sense of all the data we are gathering. I'm just not sure about the best place to find these engineers when we're pre-funding?¬†

Prior startups we did were VC backed. This is our first time taking a different approach and bootstrapping it to the first customers hence Looking for advice!¬†¬†

I'd also love to talk to anyone looking for a new venture to join, but would not want folks to feel like I'm asking for work for free. Other details: we're a 2-person team, roughly 8 months old, the core MVP is there, including integrations to the various communication channels but we did a lot of hacks for demos and now need to build a real product.

We can offer equity at this point and an opportunity to make an impact on the product, with a competitive salary once we raise our first round.

Idea Concept: A Question-Answer Based Friendship Platform Using Short Videos In online communities, people often have different opinions, and voting is a common way to express preferences.

The concept involves an algorithm that matches people based on shared interests and questions. If you don‚Äôt like a question, you can swipe it away just like on TikTok. Anyone can ask or answer questions, and the questions can be in the form of short videos, images, or text. The key is to find people whose answers match the question by 70-90%.

The goal is to create a space where people can find like-minded individuals, which, in turn, fosters meaningful interactions. Through video, text, and image content, users can answer questions and swipe through others‚Äô inquiries, leading to a dynamic exchange of ideas. Since anyone can ask questions or provide answers, the platform encourages a continuous flow of engagement and the discovery of new perspectives.

Note: I have written by transcribing my speech to text through AI and making mods. Just so if it matters.  
  
Hey young entrepreneurs, I wanted to share an insight into what real entrepreneurship is like. From the outside, it might look flashy and glamorous, especially when you hear about someone making an exit from their startup. It can seem like they‚Äôve achieved everything in life. But the truth? It‚Äôs far from that.

I graduated from IIT Madras in 2016, and even before finishing college, I started a digital payments startup. Back then, digital payments were on the rise but weren‚Äôt as common as they are today. Paytm wasn‚Äôt the giant it is now‚Äîit only began scaling aggressively after demonetization.

So, we got good initial traction. Just before graduating, I managed to raise funding as a student, which was rare at the time. I skipped placements and went full-time with my startup after graduation. Things were great at first; we scaled fast. But soon, we burned through our funding with cashbacks and user incentives, all in the name of growth. One and a half years in, we realized we hadn‚Äôt figured out a way to monetize our users, and with Paytm aggressively taking over the market, no investor was interested in funding smaller startups like mine. It was a dead end.

Two of my co-founders decided to leave and move on. But I stayed. I wanted to give it one more shot. With barely any funds left, I had to let go of 90% of our team. Those who stayed were there voluntarily, without salaries‚Äîmyself included. I moved from Hyderabad back to my hometown, Bhopal, and turned a room in my house into an office to save rent and living expenses.

Through my network and reputation, I managed to raise a small round of funding, and we pivoted to a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending model. This time, I had learned my lesson: the model needed to be profitable from day one. And it was. Over the next year, we saw great growth. It felt like we were finally on the right path. I was enjoying a good salary and living well.

But just when things were going great, the RBI introduced new regulations for P2P lending, and we weren‚Äôt able to secure the required NBFC license. At 22 or 23, it was hard for us to meet the conditions needed to get that license. So, in 2018, I sold my startup to a larger company that could navigate the regulations.

Now, many people think that when you sell a startup, your life is set, and you‚Äôre rolling in cash. The reality is, most startup acquisitions are stock swaps. In my case, most of my deal was in stock, not cash. So, while I joined this new company as part of the acquisition and have had an amazing time working with them‚Äîhelping with fundraising, strategic planning, and financial modeling‚Äîmy financial gains are tied up in stock that I can‚Äôt just cash out.

For the past five years, my role has been great, my salary has been good‚Äîbetter than market rates even‚Äîfreedom to do what and how i want, but that‚Äôs not the whole story. Entrepreneurship doesn‚Äôt come with a sense of security. With a steady job at a big company like Google, Amazon, or Visa, you know that even if there‚Äôs a bad quarter or a global crisis like the pandemic, your job and income are likely secure. In startups, it‚Äôs different. One bad year, one bad regulation, and you could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Look at Byju‚Äôs or Dunzo‚Äîbig names, but even they face these struggles.

As a founder, the mental strain is relentless. When people say they haven‚Äôt taken a day off in years, it‚Äôs not about skipping vacations. It‚Äôs about never being able to shut off your mind. Even when I went on my first vacation after getting married, I ended up working for 3-4 days out of a 7-day trip. Imagine planning for an international trip and ending up like this. (An understanding partner works wonders)

Even now, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about my current startup‚Äîwhere we‚Äôre headed, how to ensure our model is sustainable, and how to secure funding. There will never be peace of mind, not for the founder at least. Because you know that more than your life, the 100 people that are employed with you, there life and financial stability is at risk if anything goes wrong. There families will be in trouble.  
As for me,  until we either get listed or a major cash acquisition happens, my main source of wealth‚Äîmy stocks‚Äîremains locked up.

So, here‚Äôs what I want to tell you: entrepreneurship is amazing if you want freedom and the chance to make an impact. But if you want security, it‚Äôs a different story. You might make good money, but security? That‚Äôs a luxury most entrepreneurs don‚Äôt have. Even today, despite earning well, I don‚Äôt have the peace of mind that comes with knowing that my income is guaranteed six months from now. Regulations could change, something unexpected could happen, and all the work put into the startup could be wiped out.

If you‚Äôre going to dive into entrepreneurship, be ready for the ride. Be prepared to commit 15-20 years of your life to reach that one big success. The risks are high, and so are the potential rewards. But if you‚Äôre someone who values security and wants consistent income without the constant mental battle, a job at a big company might be a better choice.

That‚Äôs the real face of entrepreneurship‚Äîthe struggles, the sacrifices, the constant grind. If you‚Äôre up for it, it can be incredibly rewarding, but know what you‚Äôre signing up for.

Hope this gives you a clearer picture of what entrepreneurship really means. And, happy to answer any questions.",13,startups,1731248527.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1go1pr1/life_of_an_entrepreneur_from_an_entrepreneur/,experience

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ee5,1gnz3iy,"Productivity hacks are overrated, says a16z VC who sold his own startup for $1.25B","I figured some of you all might need to hear this here. 
Source Techcrunch


What‚Äôs the secret to startup success? Not the trends that so many Silicon Valley founders subscribe to, Andreessen Horowitz general partner VC Martin Casado said to a standing-room-only crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt last week. 

Before joining the storied VC firm, Casado founded two other companies, including Nicira, a networking infrastructure company he sold to VMware for $1.25 billion. When asked for advice about achieving success, he warned founders to beware of ‚Äúhustle culture‚Äù trends.

‚ÄúSilicon Valley is so performative, right? There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòdoing startups‚Äô and doing ‚Äòthe right stuff‚Äô and being part of the culture club and doing networking,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to hear about all the hustle, crazy stuff. And feel free to go ahead and think about that. But if you‚Äôre doing a startup, you should really, really focus on your mental well-being.‚Äù 

For instance, he hears a lot of founders ‚Äúfocusing on how they can be as productive as possible in a given day,‚Äù he said. They script their days: wake up at 5, eat certain foods, work out, and ‚Äúfast during so-and-so times,‚Äù he describes. 

Beyond that there are productivity hacks like ‚ÄúEat the Frog,‚Äù doing your most disliked task first thing every morning; the Pomodoro Technique, working in 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks; and countless other trends.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any of that really had a serious impact. I think the most important thing is just to do the thing,‚Äù Casado advises.

Instead of filling a day with rigidity, ‚Äústartups are so hard, and you as a founder, are so traumatized that I actually think you need to kind of do the opposite ‚Ä¶ just focus on staying sane and taking care of yourself.‚Äù 

That might mean ‚Äúsleeping in and eating fast food,‚Äù he says. Founders need to understand that it will likely take years to achieve success, and there‚Äôs no guarantee that they ever will. Lifestyle hacks that may work to hit an approaching deadline might not be sustainable as a way of life for years.

‚ÄúThings always take way longer than you expect. And I think the people that actually just focus on their well-being are the ones that survive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you can survive, at the end of the day, you‚Äôll have a shot at winning.‚Äù",345,startups,1731239890.0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gnz3iy/productivity_hacks_are_overrated_says_a16z_vc_who/,experience

I failed a lot of times. Literally I could build the whole landing page, admin panel, ai automation to handle moderation and content. After spending months in vacuum building more, more, more features. Launching and getting 0 customers in the end. 

You are literally just getting depressed. 

You know that feeling, right ? Me too. 

We missed one important step before building anything - ASKING. We need to ask more clients, users, and do our research based on Google Keywords, forums and subreddits. 

You probably won't do it. It is your choice. You have all rights to do it. Let me give one piece of advice, instead of building more features and spendings months on your MVP.

Set a deadline in 2-4 weeks. Build it, launch it, and go live as soon as possible. You need to get a real feedback and face a reality. 

Most of the companies that you see, started with simple Excel file, Google Doc, or even paper with pen. Do you know why ? Because they didn't have anything in the beginning. No money, no customers, NOTHING.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37eea,1gnp0a0,Made 60k mrr for a business by just lead nurturing. Need suggestions and validation. ,"Apart from the story I need a suggestion and validation here. It's a bit long, skip to tl;dr if you 
couldn't handle length.

A few days ago, I saw a person on Reddit sharing his struggles that,  Even after generating a lot of leads from ads of Meta and Google (even with lowest cpc cpa cpl), he was not able to  convert them into sales. 

Out of curiosity I dm'ed him with all fancy services that I offer and expressed that as a agency I would work with him for monthly recurring fee. He suggested for one time consulting fee, I agreed. 

It  was literally a eye opener for me. This guy is in coaching business offering courses for people. His niche was too vague. Courses were on mindset coaching, confidence and public speaking coaching, right attitude coaching,  manifestation coaching and all crap shits related to this. At first I thought he was not getting sales because who will pay for all this craps. I openly discussed with him that he has to change what he offers because, if I saw this ad I wouldn't buy this for sure. He then showed me how much money people offering similar service are making . I was literally taken back. He was part of a influencer group (the main guy who encourages these guys to start coaching business, looks like some mlm shit) where people post their succes stories. Literally lot of guys were making above 150k and 200k per month. Even with very basic landing page and average offer They are still winning. 

Here's where it gets interesting. I tried to clone everything that the top people in this industry are doing in marketing from end to end.( like the same landing page, bonus offers around 50k, exclusive community, free 1 on 1 calls for twice a month).Nothing worked for a month and later surprisingly  even the sales started dropping a bit more. 

I got really confused here. So to do a discovery I went and purchased the competitor course and Man I was literally taken back. Like he has automated everything from end to end. You click the ad, see vsl, you have to fill a form and join a free Skool community where he gives away free stuffs and post success stories of people who took the course. Now every part of this journey you will get a follow up mail and follow up sms. Like after filling the form. after that now if you join and don't purchase the course you will be pampered with email and sms filled with success stories. For sure anybody will be tempted to buy the course.

Here is the key take away. He was able to make more sales because he was very successful in nurturing the leads with follow ups after follow ups. Even after you purchased his course he is making passive income from 1 on calls and bonus live webinars. So follow ups will be for 1 on 1 calls and webinars after the course is over. 

Core point is our guy even after spending 2 to 3k per month on ads was not able to bring huge sales like competitors because he failed the nuture them. Even after making the same offers and the same patterns of marketing as competitors, the sales declined because people thought this is some spam that everyone is doing because the template of the ads was very professional and similar. suprising one is people fall for basic templates thinking it's a underrated one. 

so what we did here is we integrated a few softwares into one and set up all same webinars, automated email and sms follow ups, ad managers for stats, launched him a free LMS platform where without any additional fees so he can uploaded unlimited courses, skool like community and add product's like Shopify ( he was selling few merchandise with his brand name on) where he can add unlimited products with connection to all payment gateway, integrated with crm with unlimited contacts, workflow and lead nurturing with calender syncing for 1 on 1 calls.

But these are a bit old school, what we did was even better. integrated a conversational ai with all of his sales platforms and gave a nocode automation builder with ai for the workflow. we also set him up with a ai voice agent that's automatically calls and markets for his course and also replies for queries when called.  we also set up him a dedicated afflitate manager portal with automated commissions. 

Though he didn't cross 100k Mark, He did a great number after this. He was struggling with 6k sales, now he has reached somewhere mid of 45k to 50k mrr. Max he hit was 61.8k. I see this a big difference.So one small thing, nurturing the lead can bring you immense sales. 

To set up all of this it costs around 1.2k monthly for me with all the bills. ( I know there are few free for Individual user platforms out there, but It gets very costly when you switch to their premium plans. with heavy volumes you would require more than premium they offer.) I offered him like 3k per month to work as a agency for him who takes care of all these stuffs. He declined and offered for one time set up fee stating that he will pay 1.2k directly. The one time fee was also a bit low, though I agreed since this was a learning for me. 

what happened next after that is, he referred me to a few other people in the same niche. But the problem is they are not interested in spending 1 to 2 k in bills for software. They requested that if, will I be able to provide the saas alone for less than 500 dollars with one time set up fee. I haven't responded yet since I have to take an enterprise plan for all the software used and pay full advance price for billings. Then to break even that I have to make minimum 50 or odd users for that. let's grantly say 100 users with all other future costs. 

So here's what I'm planning to do. I'm planning to offer this as saas for let's say 239 dollars per month. with may or may not one time set up fee. ( I checked the entire internet, there is no single person offering at this price point for unlimited. Also one can easily start their marketing agency with this.) 

The suggestion and validation that I need here is 
1.are you going through the same struggles or faced these struggles?
2. would you be interested to buy at 239 dollars per month?
3. let's say you're from a different niche, Did the features I told were okay for you or you need something specific for your industry that you will be interested in buying? 

please answer in comments and if you will purchase for this price let me know in comments/dms. I will take that into account and if the response rate is above 100 queries, then will integrate this and sell for that price. 

(ps: If you see this post on similar subs, please bear cause I'm trying to get suggestions from different POV)

tl;dr - 
* lead nurturing can massively boost sales
*I made a software integration for a client for a 1.2k per month billing and here I want to know if more than 100 people are interested so that I will make this into my own saas and sell it for like a cheap price of 239 dollars per month

I have a very clear vision of how the product will be. But I know nothing about starting a startup or manufacturing a product. 

My question is to all the product based company owners. How would you start a product based startup if you started all over again?

Some details about me for context: 
I am a Fresher Software Developer who has no idea about product creation or management. I saw a market gap and thought of a practical product which in my opinion has a good scope for sale seeing the market gap. I know that it can be done in China, but I am not sure how to pull this off. I don't even have any seed money to put in this. 

What would you have done if you were in my situation?

What systems and human resources do I need to set in place to get my company started and working properly for creating and selling this product?

The rough plan that I have is to somehow get the seed money (from incubator or Kickstarter or something) and contact a Chinese manufacturing company to make the product, and then sell on Amazon, Flipkart or Alibaba. 

To understand the process first, I am thinking of making a test product (dummy product which is already established in market and sure to sell..... like a doorbell or a handfan or a Type C charger) in a small quantity (50 - 100 pieces) and sell on Amazon. And I will do this test with my own money. After understanding the process, I am thinking of approaching the investors or incubators for seed funding for the real product.

What advice do you have?",5,startups,1731185914.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gnjsp3/how_would_you_start_a_product_based_startup_if/,question

Do I need to give them a prototype or a detailed blueprint of the product or will they make it with a basic discription? Will I be able to do all this online? Because I really can't afford visiting China right now.

How did you arrange funding for the product manufacturing? 

How many pieces did you manufacture for the first iteration of making and how are where did you sell them? 

Did you sell the first batch at profit, loss or no-profit? Why did you decide to do it this way?

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ef4,1gnaztf,Do you really need to talk to 50 people before working on a product?,"# Do you really need to talk to 50 people before working on a product?

Nope. Let me show you why through a practical example.

I recently worked with founders building tools for small sales teams. Everyone told them to ""talk to at least 50 salespeople."" But here's what actually happened when they focused on just 12 of the right people instead.

When founders chase ""50 interviews"" here's the mess that happens:

- They talk to anyone willing to give feedback
- They accept input from people who ""used to do sales""
- They drown in conflicting opinions
- They hear unhelpful advice like ""Just use Salesforce better!""
- Their notes become a jungle of contradictions
- They end up more confused than when they started

Here's why: If ten sales reps managing 20+ deals each quarter are trying to stay on top of follow-ups, they're probably:

- Using some combo of spreadsheets and calendar reminders
- Hitting identical walls with pipeline visibility
- Creating matching workarounds between tools
- Wishing for a way to know which deals need attention now

By conversation 12 with the right people, you'll be finishing their sentences. That's not coincidence. That's pattern recognition.

The usual traps that lead to bad research:

1\. The investor trap when investors push for ""more research,"" they connect you with:

- A VP of Sales who hasn't managed a pipeline since 2015
- An advisor who ""scaled multiple sales teams""
- A sales director who has their SDR handle follow-ups
- Other founders who ""built a sales tool once""

2\. The random sample trap

- Mixing active sales reps with ""anyone in revenue""
- Getting vague feedback like ""Most reps would probably...""
- Hearing generic opinions like ""Just add AI to everything""
- Counting coffee chats as customer research

What makes someone ""right""?

- They're managing 15-25 deals right NOW
- They've tried Salesforce, Hubspot, and countless spreadsheets
- They can show you their morning follow-up routine
- They have quota to hit this quarter

You've found your pattern when:

- You know they're using a separate spreadsheet before they mention it
- You can guess their Monday morning process
- Their frustrations with missed follow-ups sound familiar
- More interviews just confirm what you already know

Here's the truth: 50 random opinions will give you 50 different directions. 12 conversations with sales reps actively juggling deals will show you one clear path.

3. Open source it because technically I haven't put in my mind / much effort to build something of my own. So open sourcing makes sense so that it will benefit other developers in case they want to reuse in their web / app.

Question:

1. This is not the standard way of business, this is fun side project. I am not sure how should I proceed ahead. I should go ahead and build few games and keep it live? 

2. If I want to monetize this, what are the different ways to earn money out of it apart from ads? I am not a game developer and frankly I am not confident that I will be able to develop something which will make the players feel wow.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37ef9,1gn6url,A Non-Milestone,"I have been working on my idea for two years now. I started in 2022 with a market study to determine if my product would have the demand I thought it would. I only got 200 responses but it was something. I don't have a tech background so that was the biggest challenge I had to deal with.

  
I tried getting rough estimates from developers and got figures in the range of $80,000. No way I could afford that. Not only do I not have a net worth, but I don't even make anything capable of reaching that if I saved for a decade.

  
So I came to Reddit and sought a cofounder. Many guys in my country's subreddit wanted a paying client rather than a cofounder. They weren't what I was looking for. But I was lucky, I found a very nice cofounder who agreed to come on board and work with me on the idea. This guy doesn't even realize how much it meant to have someone believe in my idea.

Anyway, it has been nearly 8 months now since he came on board. I was contemplating going back to medical school but I realized this idea was my passion. I am not very social but for the first time, I know I will knock on doors every day, every night, all year until I get the funding to go to market.  
  
He says he's making great progress towards the MVP. Now the goal has shifted. I thought getting an MVP was the greater challenge I would face, but we got through that. Now I move on to seeking $600,000 in funding and the subsequent licences. And I have never been so motivated to go for anything. Never have I been so sure that I will overcome my anxiety, my fear of failure, and disappointment to make sure I get this done.

My cofounder may not realize it but he got me through the biggest milestone I thought I had to face. To him, it is a non-milestone because he was just doing stuff he loves to do. To him, I am eternally thankful. Onwards!!",13,startups,1731146290.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gn6url/a_nonmilestone/,experience

It‚Äôs easy to get excited and pack in every feature, but this often leads to delays, extra costs, and, most importantly, missing out on real user feedback.

In my experience, focusing on the essentials and getting a version out quickly is usually the smarter move. Early feedback helps shape the product based on what users actually need, not just what we think they might want. A lean product keeps you flexible and can save you from the drain of feature bloat.

Elevator pitch:

I see millions of Americans carrying over $3.2 trillion in unsecured debt, yet traditional debt relief programs only reach a small fraction of those who actually need help. My platform empowers people to tackle debt on their own terms, without the high fees and complicated processes that usually come with debt settlement services. I offer easy-to-use tools and optional support, so users stay in control and save money. It‚Äôs a smarter, simpler way for people to get out of debt‚Äîand a huge opportunity to make a real difference in a market that‚Äôs ready for change.

Scaling from the MVP which I am working on now (learning all of that from scratch so it‚Äôs taking a bit of time) I plan to seek out a CTO since as this scales and grows I think it would be beneficial as I plan to have this heavily rely on AI and I want to really make sure to craft a quality product, not just for my clients, but also for legal purposes. 

A large part of this I think I will need a lawyer for, and likely I will need to keep one on for the entirety of the company, due to the financial sector this is centered around. 

Would it be more prudent for me to bring CTO and a legal advisor on as co-founders do to how much they will probably need to be involved? Or should I hire out what I need to until I have an MVP?

here's my current situation: 

\- I've been building a d2c brand since the beginning of the year. it has promise and we're making good progress. i want to stick with it and don't want to give up.

but, with everything in business, it is taking longer than expected to get some of the fundamentals in place, that I believe will put us in a good position to raise investment. so i'm going to keep plugging away with it.

at the same time, we're bootstrapping and I need to generate cashflow for myself.

here's what i've tried:

\- building a cold email consultancy / agency where i help people improve the copy of their cold emails. i've been able to successfully cold email some prolific entrepreneurs like shaan puri, sam parr, andrew wilkinson, sahil bloom and more. have helped two clients with this so far and have made a total of $2k. 

\- i was struggling to get traction beyond this, and so decided to pivot to consulting healthtech startups. I was previously an ops guy at a healthtech startup in london for 3.5 years and helped to scale, and figured I have a lot of experience I can help other healthtech businesses with, as a special projects / chief of staff type consultant. again, not really had much traction with being able to get a client for this.

i'm determined to build something service based alongside my d2c business as i believe it can be a great way to get cashflow and cover my basic expenses. and i need to get something going asap as i'm running out of runway.  
  
what would you do if you were me?

I feel there's something in the cold email agency. i know i'm very good at it and i can help other people. it's already been validated with the money i've already made. i feel maybe my positioning isn't right?

so far, I've only really helped solopreneurs who want to use cold email for their SaaS, but i feel they might not be the right niche given solopreneurs trying to get clients don't really have budget for an agency / consultant.   
  
any ideas on which niche to focus on?   
  
some ideas i have:  
  
\- indian software engineer agencies (i'm indian myself but british indian and my english is strong)  
\- healthtech startups (given my professional background) looking to use cold email for lead gen

**My Question:** Given these metrics, what would you do if you were in my place? Should I continue trying to grow and improve the app, or best to discontinue it and call this a failed startup and move on to something new?

I'm really passionate about this app and what I do for it, but the low revenue and retention numbers have me doubting whether it's worth further investment of my time and money. considering I am not able to get it organic reach and visibility I think it deserves.

p.s. Apps in this category have the potential to reach thousands in MRR with even lower-quality content. So I'm not sure if I'm just facing temporary challenges or if this is a lost cause.

I'd greatly appreciate any brutally honest feedback, metrics analysis, or advice from the community. Should I keep going or call it a day on this app startup?

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37f10,1gmkiib,Launched my SaaS after months of building - Sharing my hard learnings to save you the suffering,"Hey folks!

Launched my SaaS today (Video Generator) and made almost every mistake a first time founder makes.

Some learnings and mistakes to save you the suffering.

**1. Don't be Fake steve jobs:**

Fake steve jobs : I am the best, I am a product god, screw the users and customers. I will build and they will come.

Real steve jobs : I will build a shitty version first (iphone) and then iterate on it every year

**2. It's not about 1 big launch**

It's about setting up a fun and non frustrating shipping process. You ship and experiment every week. This takes time to understand but please add this in.

**3. If you're a tech product- either get a CTO or a good founding engineer**

As a tech product you need a strong engineer to iterate very quickly. Timing is important and you need to move fast in crowded markets. 

We're currently strugging with this.

4. Please do Pre-sales. For the love¬†**of god.**

Validate the ""problem"" you're solving. Your product is just a solution for the problem. Set up a landing page. Slap on a payment page. Run ads. See if you get 50-100$. Validate it. Don't build and spend 10K$ on a solution that doesn't solve a problem.

5\*\*. Launch the smallest version first\*\*

This will feel uncomfortable - and it;s good! Launch something so small and tiny first and keep building on top of it.

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37f1b,1gm8984,"Being asked to be a figurehead CEO, yay or run?","I'm a technical co-founder of an early stage startup. Between me and my co-founder, it was decided I would lead as the CEO/CTO and they will lead customer acquisition. I handle all investor relations as CEO.

Recently as we're starting to take off, my co-founder made it clear to me that it was intended that my CEO title was actually a figurehead, and I would only front the company on the outside as far as clients and investors are concerned.

As with most startups, we didn't pay much attention to organisation structure and were pretty much a flat structure. Co-founder proposed a new structure that carved a large party of the company to report under him. It's an entirely separate line of reporting that reports to him at the top and he reports to nobody, not even me as the CEO. To illustrate, I basically only have control over software development, as CEO.

Naturally I am wondering how a company with 2 sets of hierarchies works and challenged the concept. I'm also concerned behind my liabilities in bearing the CEO title, being the public front, whole not having access to major company information centers such as finance. That's when the possibility of creating a Co-CEO came up.

I'm trying hard to figure out how I can continue to make this work. Obviously there's concerns with meeting fiduciary, regulatory and ethical concerns here while misrepresenting centers of control. I just don't see how a startup needs such complicated reporting lines to begin with. It's unnecessary bloat without evening mentioning that no startups needs a Co-CEO in my opinion.

I don't mind stepping down and ceding CEO to him so I focus on being a CTO, however it appears that it's very much intended for me to STAY in this role as a figurehead.

In general, co-founder already makes unilateral decisions in a lot of matters of the company, from commercial to our books and investor relations. That's caused a bit of a friction as it usually runs counter to my direction, and sometimes I only find out about things after they've happened. Hence I'm wondering if it might be easier to stop looking over my shoulder and just step down. Though I've read that founder infighting and power struggles at an early stage are a strong indicator of potential failure down the road.

Would appreciate opinions on:

1. Outlook of the company given such weird dynamics now
2. Being a 'puppet' CEO
3. Co-CEOs in a startup
4. Stay and step down to let him have the CEO or leave (still early stage so nothing I can't let go of if I wanted to)",27,startups,1731033394.0,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gm8984/being_asked_to_be_a_figurehead_ceo_yay_or_run/,experience

67558dd1eeb7770cf0a37f1d,1gm6vac,Exciting times ahead,"A short story.

My tech startup was founded just over 2 years ago. We started on a quasi-agency model, hand coding our product with full service for large B2B clients.

By the end of last year, we crossed $1MM ARR and grew to about 15 staff. We aren‚Äôt big on credentials so had a small friend-adjacent seed fund to give us stability.

Using all that we learned in manually delivering our product, we developed a full SaaS platform over a year and a half, and automated our own workload. Now all new delivery is done using the platform for the last 3 months, dramatically simplifying things.

The idea is now to transition to full SaaS, while maintaining a white glove branch. We got our first self-signed subscribing client last week, $66/mo.

We‚Äôre closing the year soon, having just crossed $2MM ARR this week, 30 staff, 130 clients.

But this growth rate is without SaaS! With our platform battle hardening and maturing into something I‚Äôm genuinely proud of, it will be very exciting to see where it takes us in the next several months.

My startup team and I are working on a tool designed to help founders validate whether a problem is worth solving. We'd love to get your thoughts on it!

# The Problem:

As founders, we often have an idea that sounds promising, but it‚Äôs hard to know if the problem we're solving is genuinely important to our target audience. We wanted to build something that makes this validation process clearer and more reliable. We basically want to have a 3 step by step tool that guides you in this process, from good interview questions to high quality sentiment/semantic analysis on your audio.

We validated our idea with a few peers from our university programme that are trying to build a startup and seemed interested in our tool to analyze interviews properly.

# How Our Tool Works:

1. **Input Details**: You start by providing information about the problem, your potential solution, and your target audience.
2. **Generate Questions**: Our tool generates interview questions based on *The Mom Test* principles, helping you ask unbiased and meaningful questions.
3. **Conduct Interviews**: You then interview people in your target market using those questions.
4. **Analyze Audio Data**: After the interviews, you upload the audio, and our tool analyzes it. We use AI to identify patterns and insights, helping you determine if the problem is worth pursuing.

Our goal is to make the process of validating startup ideas more structured and data-driven, so you don‚Äôt end up building something that doesn‚Äôt solve a real need.

There are just too many issues with this startup, from the lack of communication between teams, toxic management, and the lack of accountability and proper project management. And I know these are all common startup issues. But my biggest issue by far is my manager. She is so young and inexperienced and she seems like the type of person who is just paranoid about deadlines and about not seeming competent enough and not impressing the higher-ups enough. The other day she asked me to look into sth that the CEO (her direct manager) asked us to look into and we found out that it was usually led by another team. So when I wanted to update the CEO on that and let him know that the other team is usually in charge because they have those connections, my manager was like ""update him in a way that doesn't seem like you just didn't want to do it"" which I thought was so disrespectful and unprofessional. 

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.. she micromanages everything. Like when I give her my estimate for when things can get done, she negotiates with me to try to pressure me to get things done earlier. I usually push back but why do I have to keep pushing back so she can back off and start respecting my decisions and estimates? And she leaves passive aggressive comments on my drafts and is so unprofessional with her communication style sometimes. And she is always worried about being criticized by execs for stuff that's literally outside her control like unreasonable deadlines and short-notice tasks. And the other day she said that to me too. She was like ""we don't want our team to be criticized for not pursuing sth hard enough even though it's blocked by sb external!!!""

My question is: do you think she is just naturally paranoid or is the company culture so toxic that execs just have a tendency to blame and pin sth on you, even though sometimes it's just not feasible or completely blocked by sb internal or external?

Then, do a little partnership deal.  Do a little brochure website together, co-sell your separate ideas to the same potential customer or run $100 ad campaign together.  Ask them to pay for something.  Take them for a test drive.  When I get to this point with somebody, I often find that they are unreliable, incompetent, dumb or just cheapskates.  Then, I just end the deal.

Don't waste tons of time and money to do all that legal b.s. only to waste tons of time and money a few months later to undo it by accepting unvetted co-founders.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f2c,1gluj8l,Creating a subreddit as a marketing channel for my platform - First 10 Days,"Hello all, I want to showcase my attempt and take aways from attempting to create a subreddit to try and market my soon to be launching pre-negotiated car deals platform. Thus I created r/CarNegotiation with a bunch of guides and tips and information about how to negotiate down a car and first time buyer guides etc etc.

I want to highlight how difficulty it was to grow, how many views it got and some positives and negatives.

**1. How did I acquire users on the subreddit/views?**

I mainly cross posted to other subreddit with specific information relating to that subreddit. For example, posting the guides on r/CarLeasingHelp r/whatcarshouldIbuy r/carbuying etc etc.

I also built a custom feed on reddit, to which the sorted by new and looked for all new posts that had some relevance to car negotiation and commented my input on them that I felt like, was useful and helpful.

These have been my only sources of traffic, and how many new members and views I get is strictly a function of how many hours I do those two things.

**2. The results**

The results were quite shocking, sitting for about 10 hours constantly engaging in conversation has usually netted me about 30 new subscribers to the subreddit each day, which usually sits around 2,500 and around 600 unique views. I would link the photo of the insights page, but it does not let me here. I'd expect these results to continue, and with full time effort, I can see obtaining around 700 new subscribers a month, and around 50k views, which is a good amount of free traffic, that can grow also.

**3. The Positives**

The traffic is completely for free.

The traffic is targeted and I have many 1 on 1 conversations, great for any business.

Repeatable and consistent for a wide range of businesses.

Has major scalability and can views can become self sustaining if the subreddit grows enough.

You learn a lot about whatever you are talking about. I'd be lying if things I thought I new about car sales were actually incorrect, or new information I was not previously aware of.

Feels good to help people.

**4. The Negatives**

Can't hire employees to fulfill this role. Usually whatever conversations you are having are about information that is not normally known by people, like the intricates of car buying in my example. If I were to hire somebody to do reddit marketing, they wouldn't be able to offer useful information to grow the subreddit.

Takes a large time. The less you work, the less results you see. This becomes problematic for smaller teams where consuming 1 persons time, reducing the output in other areas significantly. The time commit to get to a point where the sub can self-sustain, its really at minimum a year of 40 hours of work, for the self-sustained views to be useful

Can becoming mind numbing at some points, and overloaded at others. Sometimes you feel like your having the exact same conversations over and over again. Other time you have 4 DM's to reply to, 3 comments to reply to, and 2 posts in the subreddit to reply to.

Can be bothersome to enjoy not working, knowing that its directly impacting your views and growth of the subreddit. You see the effect immediately and its undeniable. Its hard to mentally move past this point and not wear on yourself over it.

**5. Conclusion**

Overall, I do think it can work for some people given their circumstances, but for many people it probably won't be the best use of their time. For my company, it is me and 1 other co-founder, and I do front-end development, he does back-end. Since I am doing reddit marketing, no front-end design work is getting done and its slowing down progress in other areas. Ultimately, we are concluding that for us, its better to validate an idea with paid marketing and then see what our conversion rates are to see if we should continue paid ads, or looking to do free marketing like reddit, or drop the project entirely.

With that said, I will continue to grow the subreddit for some time to come, just for research and learning and understanding, and will probably drop some update progress to share what else I might learn.",5,startups,1730997050.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gluj8l/creating_a_subreddit_as_a_marketing_channel_for/,experience

Holding off for a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô product can mean missing key market opportunities and delaying the chance to get real feedback from users. Honestly, it‚Äôs that feedback loop that often shapes the product into what it needs to be.

Some of the most successful products out there didn‚Äôt start out polished - they launched early, learned from users, and adjusted along the way. In my experience, founders who go for an early launch and keep iterating based on real feedback tend to hit product-market fit faster than those who wait for everything to be just right.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f30,1gls5vh,How much should I offer as equity?,"Hey guys,

I'm a senior software engineer that is starting a company. I had the idea myself and have good tech knowledge to execute it but the MVP itself is a big piece of work so I want to add people to the founding team. My initial idea is that I'll be the only one full time committed and the others will commit about 20h a week.

I would contribute with the roles of CEO, product manager, CFO, COO and anything else I could do. I plan to work anywhere from 40h to 60h a week on this project.

Now, as the MVP will need a lot of work I was thinking about inviting three engineers, one would be the CTO (as even though I have the technical background I want to focus on the product and strategy) and two other senior engineers, all to work for about 20h a week with no salary at least until a seed round.

I already invited a colleague that works with UI/UX. Also will be working part time and no salary.

And I'm trying to find someone from Marketing and sales. This person would either work part time or serve as an advisor to help us position the product in the market and acquire customers.

  
How would guys distribute the equity?



TLDR version:

Here's the ONE thing I'd do differently:



Stop dreaming about being a founder.

Start learning from the best ones.



The uncomfortable truth:

The best founders didn't start as founders.

They started as exceptional employees at rocket ships.



Here's why this matters:



1. Learning on Someone Else's Playground

\- You see real scaling problems

\- You learn what breaks at scale

\- You understand what ""good"" looks like

(Without burning your own savings)



2. Building a Real Network

Not through:

\- Random LinkedIn connections

\- Startup meetups

\- Cold DMs



But by:

\- Delivering exceptional work

\- Being the go-to problem solver

\- Making real impact



3. Developing Founder DNA

\- Pattern recognition of what works

\- Understanding of market dynamics

\- Network of future co-founders

(All while getting paid)



The Secret Recipe at 22:

Join the fastest-growing company that'll have you.

Become indispensable.

Learn everything.



Your ideas will mature.

Your network will compound.

Your skills will skyrocket.



Hot Take:

2 years at a hypergrowth company &gt; 5 years of ""hustling"" solo



Think about it:

Every great founder story has a ""before I started...""



What's yours going to be?

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f3a,1glf5wn,How to validate ANY business idea before building it (and wasting time and money),"**Experienced Founder/ CEO here.**  
  
My team and I have bootstrapped an education company from 5k to nearly $1M revenue in 2 years.  
But I've had some other business ideas that **failed BIG time**.   
  
This is what this post is about and how to avoid that failure.  
  
So, I did try SaaS, even Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, and more. **ALL failed.**

And i hope this post helps you to not do the same mistakes that i did when i asked myself ""what online business can i start?""

I've failed not because these models or ideas of business don't work - but because I've never¬†actually **VALIDATED if there is actually real demand for this.**

I call this the classic rookie mistake for first time founders.   
And I've fallen into the trap multiple times tbh. **(5x to be exact!)**

I've never talked to real breathing human beings one-to-one if they¬†**really**¬†**needed**¬†**this and would spend money on it**.

So I've blew money that i did not have, a lot of time and energy into a thing that i've build - but - surprise, surprise -nobody wanted it.   
  
However is reading this thinking about starting something new I truthfully hope this will not happen to you - now you know this pitfall!

**So what can we learn from this?**  
Whatever business model or market you pick, make sure you¬†**validate first**.

Validation is just a fancy word for making sure people are¬†**interested**¬†in something(your product/service) -¬†**before**¬†your building your product/service.

Let me say this again:

**Validate First.**  
**Build Second**

And we want to validate¬†**CHEAP**¬†and¬†**FAST**.

ok, but how we do that?

**Here's what the smart people do:**

Before spending a single dollar, create what I call a ""*Smoke Test*""

When plumbers fix pipes, they pump smoke through them first.

If there's a leak, you'll see the smoke before any water damage happens. - Easy. 

And in business, it's the same concept:

You're testing for ""leaks"" in your business idea before pouring in real money (water)

**Example:**  
Let's say you wanna do a premium coffee delivery subscription service. Ok Great.

Instead of buying inventory and spending your 5k right away, you create a simple landing page that says  
""*Rare Premium Coffee Beans Delivered Monthly¬†to you home* *-*¬†***Join the Waitlist*** ""

There are¬†**2 ways**¬†to do that:

***You Spend Money:***  
*Now run $50 worth of Facebook ads to your target audience. (paid)*  
  
*If your don't want to spend any*¬†***money***¬†*- you have to spend*¬†***time***.

***You Spend Time:***  
find your people online and tell them something like ""*hi, i'm thinking about to start a monthly Rare Coffee Beans Delivery -- would you be interested -* ***join the waitinglist***""

If 100 people view your page and nobody signs up - you've saved yourself $4,950. - happy days -  good for you.

If 30-40 people join your waitlist - you've got¬†**proof of interest - and a business.**

This is exactly what Dropbox did - they made a video showing their ""product"" before writing a single line of code. Or a more recent example is Elon Musk and his Cybertruck.

Dropbox collected 75,000+ email addresses overnight. **(and they did not even wrote a single line of code yet)**

Elon Musk collected idk how many emails + 100millions deposits of people overnight. (and he did not build a sigle truck yet)

That's validation for¬†**true**¬†**demand**.

So all we do is simply and cheaply collect signs of interest before we get moving.

I feel like a lot pf people are missing this step.

They have some $400 in liquid assets and another $100k in product ready to sell. This is in the industrial tools space. They‚Äôve generated more and more revenue, totaling some $250k in the last year and growing fast.

It started as their senior design project in college and after 2 years the 3 of them are all working full time.

I wasn‚Äôt in the OG group because I graduated a year later.

For the last year I have been helping them part time on top of my regular engineering job. They have paid me some money hourly with the promise of equity once I join full time.

Now they have enough capital and sales to where they can pay me and need my full time help doing engineering and manufacturing. I would be their first full time employee. They‚Äôre offering me a below market salary at $70k, but this is livable in our MCOL city. There wont be any benefits the first year. So they are offering equity pay. Along with the promise of bonuses for every contract we get along with a total monetary bonus based on company sales at the end of the year.

What do you guy think is considered normal for equity pay here? I‚Äôm not a real founder, but Im the next best thing and Ill be the #4 man. I want some real outside opinions here because I was best man at the CEOs wedding so there may be a bit of bias. They have retained around 93% ownership between the three of them, so they have been good at keeping equity close to their chest. 

The number they threw out was 2.5% over 4 years, with vesting at 1% at the first year and then accruing .5% every following year with the opportunity for equity bonuses depending on my performance and efforts. I‚Äôm tempted to ask for more. I want 1% a year until I hit 4% then the equity contract ends and we can reevaluate at that point, but maybe thats greedy.

Given I have to go on my parents healthcare, I won‚Äôt get any sort of 401k, plus Ill be making around $15k less than I would otherwise; I think 4% is totally fair.

So far we're bootstrapped and have about 11 months of runway. What would you do in this situation? How would you decide between these options?

1. Pivot to something entirely unrelated to climate and throw away months of research and work?
2. Continue as planned until we know for certain we have no chance of succeeding?

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f47,1gl1l01,3 things I learned about B2B SaaS that you should know if you are building/growing your startup ,"A little bit of context. I'm a growth marketer specialized in **B2B SaaS startups** with over 5 years of experience.

I worked with a lot of different startups, helping them increasing overall growth of the company.

Those are the main critical barriers and mistakes I recognized as a common pattern along the years that you likely want to avoid.

**1. IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO VALIDATE A PRODUCT WITHOUT ACTUALLY BUILDING IT**

Yes, you can do a smoke test sometimes, but in most cases, **this is not gonna work**. In the **SaaS** industry, where the **barriers of usage** for a user is very low, if you don't give the product to the hands of the customer **ASAP**, be sure that he will **switch** **instantly** to a competitor that actually offers the product already working.

It doesn't have to be perfect. It's better to adopt a ""**build fast, improve faster**"" approach, in order to market as soon as possible your product, give it to the hands of customers and r**eceive feedbacks**.

**2.** **THERE ARE 2 STAGE YOU NEED TO OVERCOME (and probably hate): BPMF** *(before product market fit)* and **APMF** *(after product market fit)*

It is **damn difficult** to reach the PMF stage, but you'll know for sure once you've reached it. When? When you can't keep up with the **customer support requests!**

If you are making less than **$500k/yea**r, and you still don't have an ICP, you **HAVE NOT** reached the PMF, so you are in the BPMF. In this stage, don't even think to scale.

Focus only on providing the most valuable product experience to the user, until you define 1-2 recurring buyer personas that account for the 80% of your total revenue.

The last element to know you have reached the PMF is a sound net promoter score. How? If at least 50% of your users answer ""they will be **VERY** disappointed if they could use no more your product/service"".

3. **DON'T BUILD SOMETHING YOU THINK USERS WANT, BUILD WHAT USERS ACTUALLY WANT**

**Ideas nowadays are useless.** Coming up with a startup/product idea must be **market-centric** (market need -&gt; product idea) , coming up with product feature must be **user-centric** (user usage -&gt; new features for the product -&gt; feature release).

Look how UI/UX impact user's usage and metrics (churn, activation,ecc.) and decide what to do next.

**Don't wonder, just analyze data**. Data is literally telling you exactly what to build, and how to do it.

I've noticed a common theme here: many of us are pouring so much energy into developing our products and growing our teams that creating consistent, engaging content becomes a bit of a backburner task. I mean, let‚Äôs be real‚Äîbetween pitching, managing cash flow, and trying to keep up with everything else, content might be the last thing we want to think about.

Yet, we all know how powerful good content can be for growth. It can build brand authority, improve visibility, and keep potential customers engaged. But let‚Äôs face it‚Äîdoing it right is tough. It‚Äôs not just about *writing* content; it‚Äôs about writing content that resonates, drives value, and aligns with the brand voice. And that requires a ton of time, strategy, and often, a bit of trial and error.

I've seen some startups take a ""post and hope for the best"" approach, which usually leads to inconsistent messaging and low engagement. I‚Äôd love to hear how everyone here is tackling these challenges. Are you:

* Relying on someone in-house to ""wear many hats"" and handle content part-time?
* Trying to do it all yourself?
* Considering outsourcing or already working with freelancers/agencies?

However, recently a local startup raised $1mn+ in a seed round to create this exact system I thought of, and essentially solves the same problem with most of the ""cherry on top"" features I imagined.

I connected with the Founder &amp; CEO of the company on linkedin, and we exchanged a few messages - more so how I was interested in the company etc. and he gave me some HR person's email for future reference.

Cool.

However, (maybe this is me being stubborn now) I honestly believe the vision their product is going in is not the right direction at all, especially if aiming for global expansion. Think of their app as more fruity, colourful, very consumer B2C looking despite it being a B2B - and my vision being more professional, enterprise focused and ""sleek"". I know multiple people in the industry who wouldn't let their ego suffice to a consumer looking product, because at this level sure it may be more productive for businesses to use the product, but if it doesn't entice them from first glance why would they use it if it won't bring major earnings growth etc (which this product won't directly - it's more of an efficiency boost).

My question now is this, do I either:

a) Build my own platform, following the vision that I intend on (a lot of UI and cultural changes rather than technical feature changes)

or

b) Join the company, but work as a part-time/full-time (idk) sales associate? I'm very confident in the fact I could sell this system to the right people and expand the company, but I don't support the vision of the product 100%

To get his first users, he started by reaching out to influencers and small businesses in his network . beacuse he got a powerful network he offered free trials and personalized demos to get the ball rolling.

At first, he was obsessed with feedback. He was constantly asking everyone for their opinion, from his mom to his dog. But I told him, ‚ÄúDude, chill out. You don‚Äôt need to listen to everyone. Focus on your early adopters.‚Äù

So, he started emailing his first users directly. He‚Äôd ask them specific questions like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your biggest pain point with social media scheduling?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat feature would you love to see next?‚Äù

**But things weren't as simple as he thought.**¬†He got feedback from all sorts of channels: emails, DMs, even random messages on social media. Some people were honest, others were just trying to be nice. And then there were the friends and family who were too scared to give real feedback.

It was a total mess! he was starting to think about giving up. I totally disagreed. I knew his tool could be so helpfull So, we came up with a plan: create a small Discord community where users could share their thoughts and ideas. It worked! People started to open up and share honest feedback Seeing how much this simple idea helped my friend, I realized there was a bigger opportunity. I remembered that day when I told him to focus on early adopters. I thought, ""Why not help others too?"" It's a win-win situation.

So, I started sharing my experience on various online communities, helping other founders collect feedback more efficiently.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f5f,1gk8518,Unsure how to manage co-founder issues,"Reason I'm writing here is that I'd like to be challenged on the below, and see a perspective I might be missing.

Long story-short, I'm a fairly senior Enterprise IT Sales Director, and I've recently joined forces with a former co-worker a very talented Head of Delivery, from one of my previous jobs, and started a Staff Augmentation business, focused on senior IT professionals. 

He's focused on the people, I should be focused on bringing in new business. Easy, right?

He was looking to join forces with smb in sales, I was looking for a new opportunity. We matched our interest. We were talking about a partnership with equal rights, so evenly split. I then learned he already had one customer with whom he had an engagement of 15FTE (meaning is less important than the number). So it made sense that I should bring in an equal amount to start in the partnership.  So we agreed to continue on his company that already had some financial history, which has benefits in new business.

Initial results from my work started to appear after 5 months from our kick-off as ""partners"".

What I did not take into account is that reaching the same level as his will take longer than anticipated. 1 year+ versus 6 months initially( had this timeframe in my mind). Reasons for this are both objective and subjective. Meanwhile, his customer doubled in volume and value, which made my entry-point uncertain.

So at one point I raise the issue of needing to have some long-term security for the time I'm investing in promoting this brand, this business, so I propose that instead of an equal entrance point into the partnership, we sign a deal where I could become gradually a partner, proportionally to the business I bring in, compared to his one customer, up to a 50% cap. 

Surprisingly, this was a shock to him as he was still expecting to reach the agreed initial term of me reaching 15FTE. So insisted we should still wait for that marker to happen. However, new information, he was no longer willing to do a partnership that involves his customer, since ""that's his own money/work"". 

Additionally, he aluded to a mechanics that meant my shares in the company should diminish below 50% if, at one point, under yet-to-be-established criteria, I don't bring as much business anymore. He dropped it when I mentioned that's not equal partnership.

At one point, without proper thought, he even suggested that we split the business I bring in at 50% and the business he brings in, stays his forever. Also dropped it for obvious reasons.

Have to say that I mentioned, and still stand-by the fact that I'm not interested in the money he made with his own customer in the past. I proposed that I enter gradually in the company, proportionally, and that the company signs a contract with him by which it will pay him an amount equal to the profit the company's made in the past, from his customer, before me joining. However future customers are split.

The conversation reached a stale-mate, and I have to pick it up again. I'm not sure what a fair solution would be? Anyone has any ideas?

(Not to mention that this situation severely eroded my trust, I am now second-guessing everything I'm doing, and I'm fighting demotivation and disorientation.)

Scope Creep

The mother of all barriers to progress. Constantly adding new requirements will derail a project, sometimes indefinitely.

Set a clear plan from the start, and once finalized, freeze the scope to maintain focus and efficiency.

Do not accept scope changes unless the client is willing to pay for them and make sure they understand that the project timeframe will balloon depending on the amount of changes requested. 


Team Creep

Expanding the team unnecessarily adds complexity and confusion. We had clients that would demand to bring in their own product owners on the projects, which created huge headaches for our own dev team. 

Keep the team lean and purpose-driven for optimal collaboration, don‚Äôt let the client bully you (even if you really, really need them).


Death by Improvement 

It‚Äôs easy to fall into endless improvement cycles, chasing the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù product. Get the product out to the market and itirate based on feedback, interview clients and offer incentives for doing so, such as discounts and free trials. Focus on whether it works and solves the problem‚Äîthen ship.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f63,1gk5yse,How to Build an MVP (not ai generated),"After googling it. I see a lot of articles that were generated by AI.

First, they start with ""WHAT IS MVP?"".

Second, they speak a lot about MVP, not how to build it.

I will try to be as helpful as I can.  
  
1) You can build MVP by yourself.

Not ideal for everyone, especially those who don't know how to code and don't want to code it. Because, let's be honest, it is not everyone, and not everyone needs it. Someone is good at selling and marketing.

Who can:

Just use as simple things as you can, tech stack that you know, reuse all code that you have, don't create a wheel. If you build your MVP via Google Sheets, I can become your friend.

Golden rule:

Use as little money as you could.

2) You can hire dev to build MVP in-house.

Keep in mind that the average dev salary in a year will be from $55k to $75k. Also, you should keep in mind that if you want to hire them, you need someone who is good at the technical part. Because if you are a sales guy and hire a developer without any clue what it is. You will lose a lot of money. Not because he will be bad or he won't do anything. Not like that.

You will lose money because he will do what he thinks is right. Sometimes when developers think he is right, he could be right from the technical side. But he won't be right from the customer side.

Because customers don't care about your fancy tech stack, cloud platform, VPS, and other fancy words. They care about your solution and how much it costs.

3) You can hire developers as freelancers to build MVP.

It will be a good option if you know that freelancer or even if you got contact from someone you trust. If it is not the first two options. I would skip this step. It is risky because freelancers won't take any risks to build your MVP or even run away with money.

Rules from the second step will be exactly the same. If you are good at the dev part, you can hire and divide all projects into smaller tasks. Otherwise, I won't recommend doing it.

4) Using no-code/low-code platforms

Also a good option to consider. Your first MVP should be as simple as it could be. Those platforms are good for creating basic solutions. Especially if your idea is not unique and has a lot of competitors. I would recommend this step to the most 80% of founders. First, you can start with that. If you have enough customers to pay the bills and you can't add more custom functionality, then move to the next steps that I will mention.

5) Partner with a technical co-founder

I would recommend this option if you know that person well enough. Partner in business is like partner in life. You should choose wisely and ask a lot of questions. Most of the time, it won't work. Because there is a lot of ""but."".

6) Working with development agencies

There are a lot of good development agencies. What is the difference between a third step? Good question, I know.

Agency has name, and it takes responsibility. At least it should take :)

Of course, do your own due diligence and choose your own way.

If you need help with development agencies, you can write to me. I will try to help with that.",0,startups,1730811188.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gk5yse/how_to_build_an_mvp_not_ai_generated/,experience

First time, you need to solve your own problem. After that, go to the exact niche communities and try to show them.

Second time, go to those niche communities and see what problems they have, and do they pay someone to solve those problems ?

Third time, go to the Google keyword planner and see results on topics in which you are interested. Just go to Google and paste them. You will see relevant answers, are they good enough ? Do someone make from it ? If yes, go to the pricing section and see on what things they focus.

Example:

If you are searching for an uptime monitoring service and the first website (after ads) focus on monitors and notification systems. Then it means where you need to focus. Go to the 10 more competitors and see common patterns. Copy common things and improve them.

Perfect scenario:

Build them, improve them, find clients from those websites, and suggest them free usage in exchange for feedback.

Do it with 50-100 people. Analyze those requests and take common words from them. After that, go improve one more time.

Critics, admirers of Seurat, show up one by one, justifying the laser show, ‚Äútimes change so quickly‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the challenge of our work, you never which movement is going to hit next, which artist to embrace.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat is the state of the art, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

	The thing is, this struggle is the process. Just like in art, startups are about more than the end product‚Äîthey‚Äôre about everything we pour into them along the way.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f6c,1gjs9f1,Getting market validation quicker through beta testing?,"I am aiming to launch a company that sells audio plugins people can use in creative projects. I work a fullstack engineering job during the day but have been building audio projects for some time now and have had a loose idea of this company for a while now.

The problem is that what I consider necessary to launch the MVP (not just a plugin but the company as whole) is still a considerable amount of work, while I would like to focus on getting market validation for the actual plugin ideas as quickly as possible. Here's what I would ideally ship as part of an MVP / company launch:

- At least one complete plugin ready to sell
- A website to purchase the plugin and access your account
- Plugin authorization system to avoid having ""unlocked"" deliverables in the open

Minus the plugin authorization system I have built all of those things before, however it will still take a lot of time to build all of that out so what I am considering instead is ""soft"" launching with:

- One free downloadable plugin
- One plugin ready for beta testing
- A website that is basically just a landing page with an email newsletter signup that will give early adopters access to beta versions for testing

The only thing I need to build here is the website which won't take very much time. This way I can get the plugin into customers' hands and see how it actually fares out in the open. Then when the product is ready and I've had more time to build out the website and infrastructure more, officially launch the company and with the first paid plugin.

There are a couple concerns I have with this approach, namely that I want to maintain engagement and excitement with early adopters from opening the beta to the official launch. I worry about development being somewhat inconsistent making early adopters lose interest. Additionally, it would be great to have a more dedicated channel to receiving feedback directly from early adopters. Basic email communication is one way; I could fire up a Discord server although that seems a bit overkill at this point? I do see that being useful in the future for people wanting to chat, ask for support, etc.

Is this a practical and sensible way of thinking regarding the steps to an official launch?

I have been building and MVP to release to app store, get some traction, and maybe start raising money to deliver better software, but the challenge is reaching my ICPs.

For ex. my app is all about receipt app, something like Dropbox, so my target user profiles are either consumers, or small businesses.

small businesses may be easier to reach but I have been pondering how I can reach consumers. that is a whole different beast!

I want to pursue the B2C market because that is highly underserved, and maybe call it as an ego, or really sticking to the vision and goal of the product.

I know receipt apps are too saturated, privacy issues, unprofitable, etc, but there are couple of apps that does it and the demand is there.

what do you think?

**The big problem you are helping solve:**¬†It doesn't matter what business it is, if they miss a phone call, it typically results in a lost customer. I actually experienced this personally yesterday. I called a service technician to help fix a issue we had at our house, they didn't answer, went to voicemail, and the mailbox was full. We called the next repair technician!

**The solution:**¬†Provide a software service for businesses that utilizes a friendly Voice A.I Receptionist to answer the calls and take down the customers info for a call back at a later time. I have been training an A.I. receptionist over the last few days and it is incredible how good it is. This is going to be game changing for so many businesses. It's easy to train, easy to setup, and it's easy to sell to other local businesses.

67558dd6eeb7770cf0a37f79,1gjcq0x,Why join a startup as an employee?,"I have an offer to join a startup as one of its first 6 employees. As one of the first employees what would be considered a fair or really good deal? 

The company will match my current salary + some, and give 0.5% ownership of the company. To me this feels a little bit low considering the risk and high amount of work to be expected from joining. But maybe I'm just entitled or think about it all wrong? 

The startup is doing it's first round of fundraising where 1% equals roughly $100 000. Funds are planned for a 2 year dev cycle before round 2. 

I'm being met by arguments that 0.5% is an amazing deal that most people would throw them selves at. But I can't really make myself see why it's so good given the high risk of any startup and that the four founders would have the lions share of earnings even after taking in round two of investments. 

Why would anyone want to join something that is statistically plausible to fail without having a significant share in the potential earnings? What deals do startups usually give the first batch of employees and what's expected of them? While it would be a high passion project for me I also live in the real world and want (very) high rewards if I take high risks. 

Perspectives and thoughts are very welcome. Do I need to get my head out of my posterior regions here? People who hire for startups, why do people usually join besides from it being passion projects? 

Edit: Thanks for all the input peeps. It sounds like the general consensus is that it's a fair deal. If its worth it comes down to personal preferences and willingness to take risks.

A YouTuber mentioned that having a working Stripe integration gives a better impression, so I added it to my apps, transforming them into SaaS models.

To fix this, I built FeatureFlow for my own projects to gather instant and better feedback. Then i decided to launched it on Product Hunt and ended up getting ""PRODUCT OF THE DAY 2nd PLACE"", I was so happy, months and months of work finally paid off.

I understand that I should start broad: Not focusing on my skill set or the profession/industry I have experience in, which will allow me to identify issues, I would have not expected before.

Makes sense. So I messaged a lot of people, to ask to interview them. I got two responses which resulted in one interview till now. It went semi-well. I had the feeling the interviewee was not sure what to talk about. The second response was, ‚ÄúThe email is a bit generic in terms of the problem. Is there anything in particular you are looking for?‚Äù. The third response I got was at a meetup from different people at a panel talk. Where the replies were very broad, like my question:

What‚Äôs the biggest challenge you‚Äôve faced in your professional day-to-day in the last weeks?

So what should I do then? When they name one problem such as ‚ÄúAmerican investors moving into Europe‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPeople management issues where job objectives have been documented, and signed but came as a surprise in the end.‚Äù?

Let‚Äôs talk about software outsourcing‚Äîit‚Äôs often a nightmare, right? Founders everywhere vent about the headaches:

1. Finding a reliable developer or agency feels like searching for a unicorn.
2. Ambiguous project scopes and timelines lead to endless confusion and missed expectations.
3. Communication gaps turn into annoying, costly delays.
4. Code quality? Hit or miss. Often more miss than hit.
5. And let‚Äôs not forget: Budget drains. Up to 30% of costs vanish into inefficiencies and agency profits. Only a fraction truly goes to building your product.

**So, what if AI could change the game? ü§ñ‚ú® Here‚Äôs my vision:**

‚Ä¢ **There are still about 30% of work need to be done by human developers. Human developers write the code and deliver the solution! AI only helps to streamline the repetitive process.**

‚Ä¢ AI Project Manager: A 24/7 AI agent ready to assist. Need to create a task, tweak requirements, or check real-time status? Done. Instantly. Pricing and timelines at your fingertips‚Äîno waiting for a human manager to respond.

‚Ä¢ AI Engineering Manager: Automates code reviews, generates solutions, and tracks developer efficiency. This cuts waste, maximizing your budget on what matters: the actual development.

‚Ä¢ AI Technical PM: Keeps everything running smoothly, orchestrating the workflow step by step to minimize risks and avoid nasty surprises.

**Who‚Äôs this for?**

‚Ä¢ Founders launching MVPs and need speed.

‚Ä¢ Companies scaling and craving efficient dev teams.

‚Ä¢ Anyone sick of the hiring hassle, craving high-quality code without the drama.

In a nutshell: Think Upwork meets AI project management, but smarter.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37f8d,1giuikn,EdTech Idea? Is this genius or stupid?,"TLDR: A platform where students create and use studyguides. And are paid commensurately to popularity/quality of their study guides.

My dad used to say I shouldn't work in school because ""college is a full time job"" but I always countered ""why do I not get paid"". I created countless pages of notes, quizletts that other students used, and for some courses like intro courses at uni the notes are pretty much the same and countless students take the course. This phenomenon already happens between friend groups but I want to moentize and mechanize it.

I want to create a platform that pays students for the work they are already doing. Namely taking notes, creating study guides, and finding the tricks to graduate easily and efficiently. It would ideally be a community like platfrom limited to students only (like reddit)... but at the very least a database of answers/ study guides/ and what not.

What would diffrentiate this community from other platforms is that it would be limited to current students.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37f8e,1gimm1k,BA round funding advice for first time founder,"We're currently in a bit of a strategic dilemma. We're an enterprise software startup (first time founders) operating in the scm space, and after months of restless work we finally got our first client and a lot of traction. We randomly met some BAs (= Angel Investor) after being invited to talk on some public panel. After months of detailed discussions, countless meetings and assessing personal and professional fit, all parties were willing to collaborate.

The valuation we agreed upon is around $6 million, and they're collectively buying about 4%. This injection will (kinda) cover our most urgent operational costs for the next year combined with our revenue (hopefully). So there is still some significant financial risk after this investment and looking at the current global economy this fear recently grew in all of us.

Did we push our valuation too high, risking the possibility of a future down round if we need more capital?  
Should we take this momentum and double down to seek out more BAs and early-stage VCs at the same valuation to secure some extra funds?  
Can we push this with the LOI of the BAs or is it meaningless to other investors?

The connection with the BAs was instant, and the discussions progressed naturally and constructively. It was very refreshing compared to our usual VC experience (recent grads without any working experience randomly reaching out to us for rushed meetings). As context we are operating in central europe atm.

I would very much appreciate some strategic advice or personal experiences.",3,startups,1730639804.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gimm1k/ba_round_funding_advice_for_first_time_founder/,question

My micro SaaS had sth to do with SEO and i want to keep the trend going.

Since i was looking for new ideas i writing down everything i am good at and i am currently passionate. One this that popped was programmatic seo, since i helped some friends of mine to set them up with pSEO and i like the idea and concept a lot.

Now i was thinking of a niche to dig in, and I did programmatic seo for Framer and other no code tools and since there is no one offering that right now i think there may be some space for me to create a small service.

So the idea is programmatic seo for businesses that use Framer as frontend for their landing page. 

That can be SaaS or other agencies.

Now the problem is that i am only familiar with doing SaaS and i have no idea on how to get clients for pSEO, and i am wondering if anyone here has any advice.

I am a developer myself, and built most of the foundational system we want to commercialise. However, I'm increasingly realising that I need to spend most of my time in a technical pre-sales role, whilst also ensuring the product is built and runs smoothly.

We're currently post-POC, pre-MVP with build costs coming out of consulting fees in the interim, but the intent is a more SaaS-ified model in the future.

Given limited resources but also a requirement for me to do less development, I'm thinking about what I can do to ensure:

\- Tasks sent to off-shore developers are communicated as simply as possible (ideally, with passed unit tests being a key requirement.

\- Documentation is available and updated. I think the best way to structure this is by architectural component? We currently have API, Front-End, and an event-driven worker backend.

\- Code is properly reviewed during PR and developers are clear on the requirements

I am currently using Notion primarily, but I am increasingly thinking about what automation I can have to further reduce the burden on myself. Projects like n8n seem ideal, but the technology is just **not quite** there when it comes to a pipeline like:

\- PR is made, AI categorises the change

\- Relevant documentation pulled from Notion

\- Code audited by LLM, key changes identified

\- New documentation written by LLM and submitted for approval as a PR task

My day job is running product at a fintech firm, and I am somewhat close to the Founder/CEO. So I approached him about the idea, somewhat naively hoping that I could fish out some pre-seed money. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything really, but figured no harm in asking.

Turns out the CEO is quite interested, but wants to develop it as a new business division. I suppose hindsight, this should have been an obvious potential outcomes.

What‚Äôs makes the proposal sensible is that my current firm operates in the same industry, practically serving the same clients albeit on different solutions. Working within the firm would give me access to resources - a technology team to build the product, sales people who are very well connected within the industry, and firm has big-name investors, which could open doors, especially valuable in my industry which is quite risk averse.

But, where there is trepidation: my firm is currently stretched across multiple products, and is still searching for product market fit. I‚Äôm afraid that by attaching my idea to a company that is already struggling at prioritizing and gaining traction, I will be spending my time fighting for resources internally rather than building the business.

I could strike out by myself and start a company... but it‚Äôll be the first time I‚Äôm doing this and I‚Äôll be starting from scratch. No money, no people, and while I understand the problem space and have some contacts, I‚Äôve never handled sales by myself, which will be crucial in getting this off the ground. A lot of this is well outside my comfort zone.

And yet, I guess I‚Äôm curious about doing a startup? I'm feeling stagnant in my current role and looking for a new challenge. I‚Äôm compensated well enough at the moment, but little growth is likely until/unless my firm finds product market fit. Level/title progression is also unlikely, given the size of the firm, and I don‚Äôt have any equity.

I think I‚Äôve found a real problem that I am equipped to address, and while there certainly will be risk, I don‚Äôt want the potential rewards diluted.

So with all of that, I‚Äôm turning to this subreddit for prerspective. What would you do in my shoes - start your own company or build a new business unit? Anyone here has done one or the other, and what was the result?

# Key Industry Pain Points

1. **Unorganized &amp; Fragmented System:**
   * **For Buyers**: Small to mid-sized brands struggle to find reliable factories for production. There's no streamlined, efficient way to partner with manufacturers.
   * **For Manufacturers**: Sourcing raw materials and finding dependable vendors is chaotic, making it hard to maintain agile operations.
2. **Lack of Transparency:**
   * The supply chain is riddled with face-to-face deals, intermediaries, and backdoor agreements.
   * Gaining business often depends on personal relationships or agents, creating barriers for new players without connections.
3. **Inefficient Marketplaces:**
   * Current platforms like IndiaMart are not specialized for the RMG sector. The presence of several intermediaries increases costs, sometimes forcing factories to use unsustainable practices to remain competitive.
   * Efficiently connecting with a trustworthy factory or vendor is nearly impossible without middlemen, leading to inflated prices.
4. **Unreliable B2B Solutions:**
   * Existing platforms aren‚Äôt built for the RMG sector‚Äôs complex requirements, such as costing, MOQ management, design communication, and payment/shipping terms.
   * There‚Äôs no reliable B2B payment and shipping system tailored for the industry. Moreover, suppliers often request credit terms, and there‚Äôs no mechanism to assess their financial reliability or ensure payment.
5. **Limited Customization Options in POD (Print-On-Demand):**
   * POD platforms offer minimal customization, leading to generic products with no real differentiation beyond simple prints.

I would like to create a end-to-end digital platform for RMG production. The place where my factory is located is home to 10,000 factories of knitwear RMG. The amount of potential for this is huge, given the nature of unorganization in this industry.

Here are some of the questions/ initial thoughts:

* How long should this demo last? 15 minutes? (our product demos typically last 1.5 hrs, this seems way too long for an investor)
* Should I mostly focus on how each feature adds value to the customer and not get too carried away with the ins/ outs of each feature?
* Is it worth showing our dashboards and monitoring tools (Azure Insights) to demonstrate user traffic and sophistication of our system? I know a dashboard isn't too sophisticated, but I want to show we've made a custom web application and not an off-the-shelf/ no code solution
* What things are investors looking for during a product demo? (scalability of platform? design of the UI/ UX? )
* Should I have the investor drive? during most demos I have the potential customer create an account and drive during the whole demo. I'm leaning towards no?
* What are common mistakes made during investor demos?

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fa9,1ghc7ak,Scaling a open-source project into a startup or leverage to something else? Even a FAANG is using it ,"Hello!

**This is my first post, so please if I'm crossing the rules tell me and I remove it.**

**Introduction and Context:**

I created an open-source project casually, mostly to aggregate my code for medium articles. Eventually became a niche open-source project, that at this point, gives me steady contractor work.

Is used already by multiple companies, from Big consulting companies to FAANG (as internal, small use cases for now).

The thing is: **I think is a fantastic project to have your name in, but not big enough to expand.**

Some startups raised VC capital and did something related, even at a smaller scale, but I think doesn't make sense given the project.

Question:

So, I want to create a new startup (with other members), not directly related.

1. Will VC's get skeptical of me having ""something on the side""?
2. Not scaling something with 1k stars on Github (eventually), a waste?
3. Will be perceived as positive and proof of skill?

TL:DR: I have a moderately successful open-source project, but I want to start a startup not directly related. Is there a way to capitalize the project somehow?

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fae,1gh8tx8,Beginner startup founder stuck in a loophole... Help?,"Hi everybody! I want to share my journey into starting a startup as part of a one semester programme at an uni in the Netherlands. 

I had a cool idea of doing a platform to connect students and startups for internship opportunities. I later larned that the market was very much saturated for it and i decided to refine the problem. The ultimate status-quo was ""startups failure is very high and 42% fail cause of a lack of proper PMF"" - therefore, i decided to see if i could do something for startups and help their process. I made up the team, we are 2 developers, one marketing / ui ux and one business - in total 4 co-founders. 

We pivoted quite a lot - from doing a B2C tool to help startups do PMF, to a management tool for incubators / accelerators to manage the progress of startups and now we were considering a B2B 3 step guidance tool for people from our course, to help them do more qualitative interviews with potential customers (we got this idea from one of our professors that said students dont go ""out there"" to talk with customers or dont know how). The plan was simple - make a very small prototype, show it to our professors, have them interested in it (as it was initially proposed as an idea by them) and then sell it to the university. 

We had a call with the professor today and she was, well.. not bought by our product. She mentioned that she doesnt think it adds that much value and ultimately that we should pivot - AGAIN. I feel kind of discouraged because for the past 2 months we have only pivoted, but it seems like we are stuck into a loophole that we cannot get out.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37faf,1gh8jgu,Are my expectations too high for a startup? ,"I've been working at my current job two years now. I left an existing company to help my boss start a new company.  We officially opened for business on the day I started my job. 

My complaints consist of: me not having an official title, my bosses unwillingness to become any sort of organized, all of our work having to come through me 1st due to my boss not wanting to pay for anyone else to have access to our software, I feel like often ppl are just waiting around on me because i'm crammed full of tasks that are more important than things like providing a cross reference part number for inventory, communication is never consistent, my boss likes to tell people important things verbally, he will randomly send an email or text, but it's never over one platform for easier documentation, he'll verbally tell our team something important that needs to get done, but because he's so overwhelmed with so many things, or won't get off of his phone to focus because he wants to be on call 24/7 for customers, it's completely incorrect information resulting in everyone else working harder &amp; unproductively on unimportant tasks, he consistently questions everything i'm doing as if he doesn't trust me, recently I needed to share something to our company drop-box &amp; I didn't have the admin permission to do it, not only did he deny me admin access to complete this task, but he also refused to attempt to add the documentations to the drop-box that I was unable to, these are just examples of things that happen often, unfortunately. 

My responsibilities are:

Create PO's for Vendors, Create Jobs in our system for customers, print packing lists, receive packages in the system, create invoices for customers, input &amp; pay invoices for vendors. Keep products stocked, pull orders, maintain correct inventory in system, book freight pickup, answer phone calls, send order confirmations, ect. I wear just about every hat possible here.

  
I guess, I just want to know if this is normal &amp; should I expect it to get better? 

There's no denying that we've been successful. My boss is amazing at sales. We're on the verge of being booked &amp; busy for the next 2 years. However, I feel like i'm fighting an uphill battle because the way my boss sees it is, he knew how to do everything &amp; was able to function ""fine"", so why should it change? None of our team can function this way. We're trying to improve now, but it's hard when resources are limited &amp; our boss complains about things like us organizing inventory, or pushes back on every single thing. It was a fight just to get inventory shelves. 

I feel if I was compensated more, it may all be worth it. But as of right now, i'm making $18 an hour with no benefits other than a week of sick time. Even if I needed insurance I wouldn't be able to afford it after bills. I just feel like it's not fair when i'm writing checks for my manager &amp; his business partner that are sometimes $25k in 2 months. 

  
Maybe i'm a whiner &amp; not meant for this kind of work? But I feel there is an awful lot being asked of me for a paycheck that I could make working at a gas station doing mindless labor.

1. Hire interns explicitly for this job - they keep searching for the relevant info on the internet and share that with the management.  
2. Have a calendar of events and look for that.  
3. Get information from incubators and WhatsApp/Discord/Telegram groups

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fbe,1ggygqk,CTO or founding engineer US -&gt; EU -- am I wildly off-base?,"I am a PhD MBA candidate at a top university in aerospace graduating spring 2025 with an offer for $230k/y sal + $70k/yr equity with SpaceX or $275k at a defense tech growth-stage startup with some equity I'm not sure.

I've recently been contacted by an EU foreign national to build X product to help Ukraine, something I certainly believe in. This is my bread-and-butter, unlike SpaceX (but the other company is similar). He mentioned in his first email that he was looking for a founding controls engineer, but when he saw my background he decided he was **considering co-founder**. He has great credentials

He says **he put in $250k** and has a product that looks good, and I think his idea is very good--I believe in the idea, but has significant amounts of technical debt. **He says his traction is a LOI** with the Ukrainian military and soldiers who want the device. I do not believe he can close the design and get the product to do all of X correctly by himself (probably can get it to do half of X), he's currently using hobby components, but he knows he will have to get serious about those things in the future. **He says he plans to raise $1.5 mil VC but no specific timeline or valuation**. On his slides, he says 50% of that will be for salaries. He does not seem to be working on the product, he mainly seems to be evaluating sites to build production later on, the complex physical product doesn't seem to have changed much in 6 months, but part of the software is getting better.

We spoke briefly and I passed a long series of technical checks with people he trusts, including people who build products similar to his. He threw out an offer of **15% + CTO + unspecified salary + move to UK or eastern Europe**, and we kind of mutually talked about about being lean as a founder on salary when you believe in the mission. It was kind of a spur of the moment ""gut check"" thing his father told him to do. I thanked him for the offer, told him I would consider it, and spoke with founders and staff here at my college to understand the offer and decide if it's worth it.

Basically everyone I talked to said that what should be worth it for me would be 25%-30% + CTO + salary at 60% of my market rate. I decided, I guess for no reason, but to be nice to my potential founder and shot for 25% + CTO + cost of living + 60k salary, or an offer that was 25% + CTO + salary of 50% market or $150k. (I gave the COL offer because he's deciding whether or not to place the HQ in the UK or eastern European nations). I told him that basically, you know, founding a company is about trust and candor, so that's what I was thinking but I was very open to talking about it and seeing if we can reach a compromise. I basically targeted 25% 150k because **I was fine with 25% + $120k post-negotiation salary** or even lower but we would have to get into pro-forma to justify.

I personally feel this is really fair for a ""gut check"" move across the world to join a startup with no complete product, no sales, and no raised funds besides his initial $250k. Equity-wise, I'm probably going to be deflated by the time we launch the first product, and there's so many market risks with the war in Ukraine.

Not so to the potential cofounder. He said he and his other employee, someone on at \~5%, are taking salaries of only $30k and he says that I have to weigh the mission--which I believe in--vs the better compensation of SpaceX, and he won't be able to get near SpaceX. He also mentioned he is reconsidering me for the CTO role because he's more worried about manufacture (downshift to founding engineer). He wants me to be involved with his team at a **low salary of $30k and no stated equity to see how we work together** (?) before making a vesting schedule and actually agreeing on equity.

I basically told him that I wouldn't quit my PhD/MBA for that, nor move. You know, am I crazy? He is aware of cliffs and vesting, why doesn't he do that? I feel like, if we're successful, he's going to make a chunk of change, I'm going to make a little, and it's going to be very worth it for him, not so worth it for me.

I basically said a CTO is a powerhouse all-star that can build the product without you in the loop if needed, e.g. when fundraising, and if I can't do that he fires me. Is that just America?

I onboarded my small community from a different genre of game I made to test this new one. Despite it being a new genre, the feedback was positive and we had direction. 

Did my best to promote the demo and future state ideas and we were able to raise $10k with a pre-sale from players. We launched the mvp just a few months later.

Since then we have generated over $30k in revenue. We have only paid $2k for aws game servers and $4k to promote the mvp and grow the player base. Our only other expense is our time. A few hours a week.

We could carry only and continue to slowly develop and ship when time allows. We have jobs and families, but we believe we have something here and we are moving too slowly. 

Are we ripe to seek investment so we can go full time to development and promote faster?

I'm an experienced dev, jr entrepreneur,  and first time founder and have only received grants and hackathon awards. No experience with investors.

 Any advice for next steps are very much appreciated. I don't feel like enough of the game has been developed to truly determine product market fit.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fc7,1ggp2bt,How can I improve in my leadership? Team lost all motivation when cash got tight.,"Looking to vent a little bit and would appreciate some advice. My co-founder and I had brought on two people to the team that were a great fit at the time. Motivated, skilled and ready to make the dream come true. We offered them a decent amount of equity being early team members and taking on some of the responsibilities of core team. 

This was back when we had more runway. Recently we had run into a lot of unexpected costs and cash became really tight. My co-founder and I have always been the type of people that advocate for communication and coming together to figure out how to get through hard times together. Him and I have gone through some ROUGH months of having no money and finding ways to liquidate personal assets to help fund the dream. My co-founder went so far as to give up all his monthly pay to help support the team when we hit this shit month. Yet cash was still tight and we had to forgo pay until this next check came in. 

The two guys we brought on seemed to view the situation like they were employees not getting paid for their work. I get it, I want to make sure everyone is taken care of. I am not expecting free work, but with giving away equity I was expecting the understanding and knowing that sometimes money is tight, but it will be worth it in the long run. 

Ever since this happened both of the newer team members have seemed to lose all motivation and drive to be working with us. Not accomplishing tasks, not showing real interest, wanting to work from home. It's so frustrating because I really just wish they would communicate with me on what is going on, even so much as saying, ""hey it's hard for me to feel motivated when no money is coming in"" , I would have so much understanding for that. But nothing? Just half ass-ing it, putting attention else where and showing none of the commitment and drive we saw early on? Now it feels weird to keep paying them when they both have literally put in no work besides some data entry over two weeks. 

  
I guess the advice I would appreciate is helping me understand where I went wrong. Was it too soon to bring on team members like that, and should I have kept them as employees instead of having the expectations my co-founder and I share? How could I have motivated better communication? I want to keep learning as a founder and this experience was a little defeating as it seems no one will be as motivated and driven for our product as me and my co-founder are. Thanks in advance.

This is a quick story of how I sold a failed project on acquire in my first 2 weeks of university 

So i made an SEO based SaaS tool that basically when you give it a website it automatically writes content that outranks that specific websites 
The problem was that i was afraid of continuing the SaaS because i got some backlash.

The nail in the coffin was when someone marked one of the websites stripe transaction as fraudulent, disputed it by accident and i almost got my stripe account suspended but i contacted the guy and everything was fine.

So i stupidly cancelled all the subscription i had, around 250$ mrr worth of it and decided to shut down the project. After i week i cracked my macbooks screen with a screwdriver driver (don‚Äôt ask how) and got a quote for 750$ :)) from apple. 
I had no money saved so i got the brilliant idea to sell some old products. Listed the app on acquire, got denied buti dmed the guy that runs it and got it listed. Acquire is a great app but escrow.com is a terrible service. In 2 days i found a buyer did all the processes and it took escrow 7 days to finish/delay the hole process‚Ä¶ and i got my money on the 9th working day. Yeah terrible service and support.

Sold the app and repaired the mac! Which is awesome.

Now i am on the next thing, programmatic seo for SaaS websites that use either framer or webflow.

67558ddbeeb7770cf0a37fc9,1ggn88j,Why Not Metered Pricing for Social Media Management?,"Hello, Reddit community!

I‚Äôve noticed that most social media management platforms typically use¬†**profile-based pricing**, where users pay according to the number of social media profiles they manage. However, I was wondering why no one has ventured into offering different pricing tiers based on the¬†**number of posts**¬†users can make each month.

# Here‚Äôs my thought process:

* **Metered Pricing**: This model would allow users to have¬†**unlimited social profiles**¬†but limit them to the number of posts they can schedule. I'm trying to target mid-sized agencies and b2b businesses. Of course, I'll create 2-3 different tiers based on different feature sets, too.

# Questions for You:

* Have you encountered any sm management platform using a metered pricing model based on post limits?
* What are your thoughts on the potential benefits or drawbacks of this approach?
* How do you think this model compares to the traditional profile-based pricing in terms of flexibility and usability for agencies?
* Are there specific pain points you believe could be addressed with a metered pricing model?

I‚Äôm eager to hear your insights and experiences regarding this idea.

**Disclaimer**: I run a social media management tool and am considering updating my pricing strategy to test this metered approach. However, I wanted to gather opinions from this community before making any changes.
