But what about the less talked-about factors? For instance, I’ve noticed startups with exceptional customer service can gain loyal users even if their product isn’t perfect.

What do you think is the most underrated element that makes or breaks a startup? Have you seen a surprising factor play a key role in success or failure?

1hcavv6,Does OpenAI go down too much to take seriously as a production API?,"Right now the OpenAI API, ChatGPT and Sora are completely down.

It's a major outage now at 2 hours 36 minutes and counting. Imagine building a product and just starting to get traction and your product stops working for 2 and a half hours.

We were in the middle of a demo just now and a key component of our app stopped working. Thankfully it didn't affect our demo too much, but it hurts.

I did the math, just looking at their reported uptime for the API alone 99.33%... that's over 2 and a half days of downtime in a year!!

Really putting a fire under us to move to another provider. Let's be real, for most things LLMs are commodities.

How would you all think about this from a supply chain standpoint?",64,startups,1733970321.0,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcavv6/does_openai_go_down_too_much_to_take_seriously_as/
1hcg7nz,Startup Culture,"- Great businesses are all about a great idea.
- Ideas are nothing; it’s all execution. &lt;— we are here.
-  Execution is nothing; it’s resilience.
- Resilience is nothing; it’s timing.
- It’s all just luck.

This pretty much sums up how I feel about startup culture. 

First it was all about the idea, people are obsessed with coming up with the next big thing. Then about execution, and we get bombarded with hustle culture… But then even great execution doesn’t guarantee success. That’s where resilience comes in - sticking with it, pivoting when necessary, and refusing to give up. Except resilience means nothing if you launch a great product at the wrong time.

But then there’s luck. The thing no one wants to admit is that luck.. being in the right place at the right time, connected or rich parents, born in the right location or right time, meeting the right person, or stumbling into the perfect market etc… often plays the biggest role. But books don’t sell the recipe for luck.

1hcvbna,MVP Question,"I’ve been working on creating a website for some time, and it’s designed to achieve three main objectives. Two of these focus on attracting attention, while the third is what truly sets it apart—it solves the core problem. I’ve made significant progress, with the first part about 75% complete.

However, I’m uncertain about when to consider the MVP ready. Should I focus on finishing the first part before moving on to gathering real customer data and using it to refine the MVP and draft a business model? Or should I prioritize something else at this stage? This is all quite new to me, and I’d greatly appreciate any guidance or advice.

1hcpl40,"Ready to run an ad campaign for my vocabulary app, where should I start?","A month ago I launched vocabulary app that lets users explore advanced english words, save ones they want to learn, and then teach themselves the words by taking simple multiple choice quizzes made from example sentences.

The idea is that we learn words by seeing them in context, so there are about 100 example sentences per word allowing the user to get exposure to a bunch of different usages.

It has about 400 downloads, most of which are friends and family + some people from reddit.

I assume I probably won't ever make much money off this app, but I have seen the main Vocabulary app on the App Store have millions of downloads + saw on SensorTower that it generates about $200k per month in revenue. I actually began using this app when I was looking for what my app offers, but honestly was not impressed with the feature offerings.

I'm assuming they probably have pretty high cost on marketing because I see them all over instagram and they come up as the first ad on the app store. Anyways, that makes me think that there is at least decent interest in the ""vocabulary building"" space and a potential to generate some revenue.

This is also my first project and I spent a lot of time on it, so I'm willing to go a few grand in the hole to see if I can get a lot of downloads. If I do, then maybe I could throw some ads on the app or introduce a premium version and paywall some of the features. Idk.

Anyways, would love to get advice on which direction to go.

This is what I'm deciding between:

1. Instagram ads - tooting my own horn here but I think the app has a pretty solid looking UI, so I think the visual nature of instagram lends itself pretty well. Also instagram ads in general seem to be very effective (at least in my personal experience)
2. App store optimization - when I was looking for an app like this I just went to the app store and looked up vocabulary, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Maybe there are other people doing the same thing?
3. Reaching out to vocabulary / dictionary / productivity influencers

I would prefer to only do one of these options and commit 1-2k over the course of a few months. But again I am a total noob to this so if anyone has insight would love to hear it.",2,startups,1734022735.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcpl40/ready_to_run_an_ad_campaign_for_my_vocabulary_app/

1hcp20z,How Do I Gather My First Users for My Deals/Discounts Website?,"Hi everyone,

I launched my website about a month ago—a platform similar to HotUKDeals where users can find deals/discounts and upload their own deals to earn a 25% commission on each sale.

After the launch, I started promoting on social media (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and slowly started building followers (Insta: 55, Facebook: 13, TikTok: 23). Through Google Analytics, I can see some traction—about 300 new visitors weekly—but apart from family, nobody has purchased anything via affiliate links.

I’m passionate about the concept and still believe in its potential. However, I’m struggling to build a critical mass of users. I know that to create a successful platform, I need more users to upload deals, which will lead to more sales, more profit, and, ideally, a positive growth loop.

So far, I’ve tried:
	•	Posting regularly on social media.
	•	Following and engaging with people active on similar platforms.

But growth feels slow, and I’m looking for actionable advice to:
	1.	Drive more traffic to the website.
	2.	Encourage people to upload their own deals.
	3.	Build trust and encourage users to make purchases.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear what worked for you. I’m open to any tips, including unconventional ideas or strategies that might not be immediately obvious.

Happy to share more details about my platform, social media strategy, or analytics if that helps!

Thanks in advance for your advice!",2,startups,1734021326.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcp20z/how_do_i_gather_my_first_users_for_my/

|VC|Comments|Overall Score|
|:-|:-|:-|
|fika|Easy to connect and schedule, spoke to an associate who was respectful and intelligent. Did a quick follow up with one of the key partners. The partner meeting looked a bit disengaged and barely asked questions. It seemed he didnt want to be there :) The associate promptly responded in a few days with a respectful reject email citing reasons that seemed genuine. Overall, would still recommend working with them based on the interaction.|8/10|
|Firebolt|The founding partner himself tracked down the startup from a ""VC dark network"". He was persistent. Had 1 call with 2 of the founding partners. They were fully engaged. However, 1 partner who initially reached out seemed to have lost interest half way and started asking annoying questions. Never heard back from them after that 1 call. Total ghosting :)|5/10|
|NextView Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. However, they rescheduled it on the day off the call. When we actually met, the partner disclaimed that they know very little about my space. They asked high level questions. Mid-way through their child walked into the meeting :) I honestly didn't mind it. Kids will be kids! But then the kid got on the nerves of the partner who lashed out their kid right in front of me. Ouch :( The partner was totally distracted from that point on. After a few days they got back promptly citing a legitimate sounding reason.|6/10|
|Ridge Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. The partner was respectful and genuinely interested in learning about the startup. At the same time earnestly raised concerns about my market and it's ability to create winners. They followed up with an investment committe meeting. The meeting invite was awesome. It had the names of the attendees and their backgrounds in good detail so it saved me a ton of time researching each one of them. During the call, all of them were leaning in and genuinely interested in learning about the opportunity. They also challenged certain aspects but did it respectfully. Finally, they promptly followed up but without giving a reason. I requested to give some feedback and the partner setup a call! However, they did a no show on the call :)|9/10|
|SignalFire|They reached out by finding about the startup from the ""VC dark network"". The main contact was very excited after the first call. He followed up with a few questions and then setup a quick follow up with a couple other people. On the second call, the founding partner was suave and respectful. Although he didn't lean in much. A principal was hyper enthusiastic trying to impress his partners by asking awkwardly challenging questions. The main contact responded promptly with a reject and citing specific reasosn which was much appreciated.|9/10|
|Vertex|Call was scheduled promptly through a strong connection. Two partners showed up and both were great to interact with. They were genuinely trying to understand the business and evaluate the opportunity. Through the call it started to emerge that they didn't see it. But despite that they were respectful, cited their initial concerns. They did say that they will get back shortly with a more thoughtful reason. But they ghosted :) At least they were nice on the call!|7/10|
|Weekend Fund|Call was scheduled promptly. The partner was not familiar with the space but leaned in with decent questions. They said they would follow up. There was silence for several days but eventually got back. They claim to be pre-seed but they said they need more traction.|7/10|
|Zero Prime|The junior partner found the deal through the ""VC dark network"". Persisted and eventually we met. He was very enthusiastic and said will quickly follow up with a partner meeting. But then ghosted. No news ever again!|4/10|
|A16Z|Connected to a partner who was from my alma mater. First call was scheduled promptly. They were genuinely interested and asked good questions. They liked the space and the problem being addressed. They promised to follow up shortly. They did follow up citing genuine reasons.|8/10|
|HustleFund|Very frustrating and unclear process. They make you fill out a TypeForm form. Its quite an unwieldy way to fill out long pieces of text. It doesn't save your responses etc. Once I submitted they just sent a reject email in less than 24 hours :D What a fricking waste of time. They logged into the deck but didn't look beyond the title slide. So they didn't really evaluate it. Stay away!|2/10|
|Canaan|Scheduled promptly. Through the meeting didn't really engage and show genuine interest in learning about the statup. They were upfront that they do only companies with traction. So they should have not really even taken the meeting. They said they would get back shortly. But ghosted!!|4/10|
|Unusual Ventures|They were definitely on the bottom of my list. After submitting an online form they very eagerly and promptly setup a meeting based on the teams profiles. During the meeting, they were waiting for one of their main partners who joined late. That partner came totally unprepared and started off with a very condescending tone right of the bat. They were combative right from the beginning and just wanted to play Shark Tank - it seemed like it was entertainment for this partner. I told him that I have already heard that you didn't like this deal and hinted that we don't need to talk any further. Through the back channel later heard that that partner is quite toxic. Stay away!|1/10|
|Boldstart Ventures|Approached them through a warm contact. They didn't take a meeting citing their genuine position on my market - they don't invest in my market. Respect to them for saving everyone's time.|7/10|
|Costanoa|Another one towards the bottom of my list. It was easy to get in touch through a warm intro and the call was scheduled promptly. Two people joined - one was a partner, it wasn't clear what the other person was. This other person was a new member on the firm. They started of asking questions to stump you. There was barely any indication of a genuine effort in understanding the business. The body language was very poor. It felt condescending. They said they would get back in 2 to 4 weeks, but they never got back.|3/10|
|Felicis|The partner scheduled time promptly, asked insighftul questions, gave clarity on next steps. After a few days responded with a thoughtful email citing their reasons. Well done! High points for overall professional engagement.|9/10|
|Array VC|This one was also on the bottom of my list. The partner does not reply to emails promptly. And when they replied they were short half sentence emails - lack of genuine interest/professionalism. They claim they are focused on data &amp; analytics. So I thought they would be genuinely interested. But they didn't go beyond email interactions.|2/10|
|Wing Venture Capital|They comfortably found the link to my deck through the ""VC dark network"", went through it without permission, probably didn't like the deal and never even contacted me. It felt very disrespectful that they just went to the deck though they were not explicitly given access to it. Shady!!|2/10|
|Wave Capital|Conneced through a friend, very nice guy. Thoughtful and attentive. Not a market fit as they are into marketplaces. But still offered to connect to their network.|8/10|
|Afore Capital|In the bottom half of my list. I connected with a partner through a warm connection. But without even responding to me an associate took over. The associate set up a 20 minute meeting!! And for that they showed up 10 minutes late. So after a 15 min evaluation from a recent grad my startup got rejected. Wow! I am sure they spoilt with good deals.|3/10|
|GGV (Notable)|They took the meeting promptly. However, there was not much interest in engaging when they were on the call. They said they would get back, but they never did. Why do their waste their own time (and mine!)|4/10|
|Battery Ventures|They were eager to meet. However, after presenting to them and an engaging discussion, they said they only do series A or later :D Then why did you bother meeting and waste my time :D|6/10|
|Lerer Hippeau|Connected through a friend and was promptly scheduled for a meeting with an associate. The associate was very nice and engaged with inquisitive questions. He set up a follow on with one of the main partners. The main partner, however, was not very engaged he had made up his mind a few minutes into the call that this is not a deal he likes, which is fine. He said he'll get back with some feedback. Couple of days later they got back with some feedback.|8/10|
|Emergent VC|Got connected to them through a friend. The partner requested for updates over email. Sent them all the updates but the partner never even replied to the email. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Ovo Ventures|Easy to schedule with them, met them through a warm connection. The partner met and asked great questions and it was a good lively discussion. They did make it clear what the concerns were during the meeting. And then very promptly followed back, citing their reasons honestly. Very respecttful &amp; professional!|9/10|
|Kearney Jackson|Met them through a warm connection and the meeting was set up pretty quickly. Both the partners showed up and engaged very actively asked great questions. It felt like I learned something. They got back promptly, giving genuine reasons. Very professional great performance would work with them .|9/10|
|Nexus|Met them through a warm connection and a meeting was set up promptly. The partner was very curious and fully engaged. The meeting was in person. After going through the business, he was upfront that he didn't see a good market opportunity. But was classy in the way he said that. He did say he would follow up, but he never did.|7/10|
|Lightspeed Venture Partners|This was again through a warm connection and the meeting was set up promptly. The partner was engaged, although it wasn't clear how much he really understood. He did ask for some time to evaluate the business. He got back after a few days in a professional manner. No real complaints but wasn't impressive.|7/10|
|Montavista|I sent an email directly to the main partner who is from the same alma matter as me. They responded quickly and scheduled  time for an in person meeting along with the partnership. Everybody showed up on time. They had six people on the call. Three in the room with me and three on a Zoom call. Couple of them has great genuine questions and wanted to understand the opportunity. However, one person was very annoying, trying to put me down several times. It seemed they were trying to justify their value to the partnership by saying things like ""I can connect you with this big guy or that big guy"". The main partner, however, was awesome. He got back promptly citing his reasons for rejection.|7/10|
|Altos Ventures|Met the partner through a warm referral. They suggested an in person meeting. However, they don't have any parking around there which made it stressful. Also, it was far away from where I live so it was too much time commitment. And what made it more annoying was that within the first two minutes we established that they don't do preseed and seed stage investments. I wish they had just done a zoom call before an in-person. To their credit the partner was very nice and we had a good debate around the pros and cons of my startup strategy.|6/10|
|ENIAC VC|Got an intro into the firm from a warm referral. However, the email responses were very slow and when they did respond, the scheduler did not set up a meeting. I had to send a reminder to get the meeting scheduled. The partner who I met with did not really lean in. They said they would get back with next steps, but never did. Ghosted!|4/10|
|Foundation Capital|Got connected to them through a warm referral. In fact, foundation wanted to meet with me. However, when we connected they scheduled a meeting three weeks out! And on the day of the meeting, they rescheduled it. And then on the day of the meeting, the partner said that they would be taking the call on voice while driving. The audio was terrible. During the meeting, the partner was condescending. The saving grace was that the partner was smart and direct which I totally appreciate. But they were disrespectful which I totally don't appreciate.|4/10|
|Peak XV|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled two weeks out! When we met, one partner was still driving to work and the other partner was running behind. They did engage actively and showed genuine interest in the problem space. They said they would evaluate the market and get back for next steps. But I never heard back. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Village Global|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled promptly. I had to reschedule the first meeting because of an emergency. But the partner was very respectful and promptly accepted the reschedule. When we met, we established that they are from my industry. That really made the conversation engaging and meaningful. They got the idea! They followed back with very good questions. They also set clear expectations about the timeline for a decision.|8/10|
|Swift Ventures|They reached out to me by finding about me through the ""VC dark network"". The meeting was set up promptly, and one of the main partners attended. The discussion was decent. The partner was humble. But knew very little about my space. I thought it was a no-go I did not bother to follow up. But they followed up a few days later asking for my deck to have a clear closure. I sent the deck and a few hours later they got back stating their reasons for not going through.

1hci1oy,Freelance/Task Platform MVP Without an Escrow System?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice from entrepreneurs, developers, and experts who’ve worked on building platforms or MVPs.

I’m based in Ethiopia, where platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit have a huge untapped market but also face unique barriers. My goal is to create a platform tailored to my country, solving challenges like:

Payment Systems: Most Ethiopians don’t have access to international payment platforms like PayPal.

Language Barrier: Many don’t speak fluent English to navigate these global platforms.

Task Complexity: Many tasks on these platforms require high-level skills. I want to focus on simple, delegatable tasks, both digital and physical.


My Plan

I’m starting small with an MVP to validate the idea. Initially, I planned to use a Telegram bot interlinked with channels to mimic the platform experience. The idea was:

Users could find and post tasks for free (no commissions).

The bot would handle task assignments and communication.

Tasks would be split into digital (simple remote tasks like trimming videos or translating text) and physical (local jobs like delivering items or assembling furniture).


However, I hit a major roadblock:
I need an escrow system to build trust between users. But to integrate with Ethiopia’s banking system, I’d need:

A registered business

A trade license

A physical office, etc.


This requires upfront money (~$2000), which I don’t have.

My Question

How can I build an MVP that attracts users without an escrow system?

Are there ways to create trust and security without formal escrow?

Can I simplify the platform further to avoid needing banking integration?

Should I pivot to a different MVP idea that requires fewer resources?


I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. If anyone has tackled similar challenges, your advice would be invaluable.

1hbxxpd,How I run customer interviews (and why they're better than analytics for 0-1),"## Why talk to customers?

Look, I've built products at companies of all sizes - tiny startups, growing scale-ups, and 500-person enterprises. The one thing that's always worked? Actually talking to customers. Especially when you're starting from scratch.

Don't get me wrong - tools like Amplitude are great at showing you what people do in your app. But they miss everything that happens outside it. Some of the best insights I've found came from discovering that people were using weird Excel templates or Word docs as workarounds. You'd never catch that in your analytics.

## Getting good at interviews isn't hard

A lot of people get nervous about customer interviews. I get it - talking to strangers can be awkward. But honestly? It comes down to a few simple techniques that anyone can learn. Here's what works for me when I'm trying to understand customer problems.

## The techniques that actually work

### Ask questions that let people ramble

The best insights come when you let people tell their stories. Instead of asking ""Do you use Excel for this?"" (which just gets you a yes/no), ask ""How do you handle this today?"" Then shut up and listen.

### Repeat stuff back to them

This one's surprisingly powerful. When someone spends five minutes explaining their process, just summarize it back: ""So what you're saying is...?""

Two things happen:
1. If you misunderstood something (which happens all the time), they'll correct you
2. They often remember important details they forgot to mention

### Go down rabbit holes

Some of the best stuff comes from completely random tangents. When someone mentions something interesting, keep pulling that thread. Keep asking why. I've had calls where we went totally off-topic and found way bigger problems than what we originally wanted to talk about.

## How to run the actual call

### First five minutes

I always start the same way:

""Hey, thanks for jumping on. We've got 30 minutes - that still work for you? Cool. I wanted to talk about [topic]. You might have other stuff you want to ask about, but let's save that for the end if we have time. That sound okay?""

Simple, but it:
- Makes sure they're not running off to another meeting in 10 minutes
- Keeps things focused
- Lets them know they'll get to ask their questions too

### Diving into the conversation

Here's the thing about good interviews - they should feel like natural conversations, not interrogations. Start as wide as possible. I usually kick off with something super open-ended like ""Tell me about how you handle [whatever process] today.""

Then just listen. Like, really listen. When they mention something interesting, that's your cue to dig deeper. Say they mention ""Yeah, it's frustrating because I have to copy stuff between systems."" Don't just note that down and move on. That's gold! Follow up with ""Tell me more about that. What are you copying? Where from? Where to?""

The best stuff often comes from these diving-deeper moments. Maybe you'll discover they spend two hours every Friday copying data from their ticketing system into Excel because the reporting sucks. That's the kind of insight you can actually do something with.

Sometimes the conversation will hit a natural lull. That's when you pull from your question bank. But don't rush to fill every silence. Some of the best insights come right after those slightly awkward pauses when people remember ""Oh yeah, and there's this other thing that drives me crazy...""

### Questions I keep handy

Instead of a strict script, I keep a list of reliable questions I can throw in when needed:

- ""How do you deal with this right now?""
- ""On a scale of 1-10, how annoying is this problem?""
- ""What's an even bigger pain in your day?""
- ""Tell me about the last time this came up""
- ""Do you use any other tools for this? Excel? Word?""
- ""If you could wave a magic wand, how would this work?""

Don't treat these like a checklist. They're just there for when the conversation hits a wall or you need to dig deeper into something interesting.

### How to keep it flowing

1. Start really broad. Let them talk about their day, their problems, whatever's on their mind.

2. When they mention something painful, dig into it.

3. Sometimes asking about the same thing different ways helps. People might not realize they're using a workaround until you specifically mention spreadsheets or sticky notes.

4. Save the ""magic wand"" question for last. By then they've thought through all their problems and can better imagine solutions.

## Stuff that kills good interviews

1. **Asking leading questions**: Don't say ""Wouldn't it be better if..."" Just ask ""How would you improve this?""

2. **Trying to sell**: You're there to learn, not pitch. Save the product talk.

3. **Sticking too hard to your questions**: If they start talking about something interesting, follow that instead.

4. **Not recording**: Always ask if you can record. You'll miss stuff in your notes, and sometimes you need to hear exactly how they said something.

## Why this matters

Here's the thing: Analytics can tell you what users do, but only interviews tell you why. The best products I've worked on started with stuff I never would have found in analytics. They came from actual conversations where I shut up and let people tell me about their weird workarounds and daily frustrations.

Sure, it takes time. Yes, it can be awkward. But it works better than anything else I've tried.",41,startups,1733935901.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbxxpd/how_i_run_customer_interviews_and_why_theyre/

1hcfpwh,Turning a Dream into Reality: Seeking Support to Empower Thousands in Ethiopia,"Hi everyone,

I’m a dreamer from Ethiopia, a country where opportunities are hard to come by, but dreams still thrive. I’m working on building something that could change lives—not just mine, but countless others in my community. It’s a platform that seamlessly connects task creators with task doers. Imagine waking up stressed about money, without a job, or being a student needing quick income. My platform would let anyone with a laptop or phone find simple, quick tasks they can complete remotely—whether it’s a 2-hour gig or a one-day job. No hassle, no stress, just a way to make legitimate money right from your bed.

This isn’t just a website to me; it’s my passion and my purpose. I want to create a credible, seamless, and addictive platform that gives people a chance to thrive. For many here, $2,000 might not seem like much, but in Ethiopia, it’s a fortune. It’s the one barrier stopping me from making this vision a reality.

Sadly, platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter don’t work in my region, and finding funding locally is almost impossible. So, I’m reaching out directly to anyone out there who believes in the power of ideas and the impact one person can make. I know this idea has the potential to transform lives, to take people from feeling stuck to feeling empowered.

If you’ve ever had a dream you believed in with your whole heart but just didn’t have the resources to bring it to life, you know how I feel. I need $2,000 to get started, and I promise this isn’t just about me. It’s about building a system that helps people in my country find dignity, opportunity, and hope in the simplest way.

If you can support me or even share this message, you’re not just helping me; you’re becoming part of a journey to create something bigger than both of us. One person’s trash is another person’s gold, and this dream is my gold.

1hc01id,Product and Message Differentiation is everything. Here's how I find both ,"**Introduction:** 

Great messaging is essential. Your message is the first thing anyone hears, reads, or sees about your business. It’s your elevator pitch, business card, tagline, and more all rolled into one.

Differentiated messaging — the only kind that really matters — is even more important. It not only conveys who you are, but who your target customers are and how you help them in a way your competitors can’t.

If done well, differentiated messaging helps every part of your organization level up:

* **Marketing** understands *who* you want to reach and *how* your company alone can help them. The team writes better copy, creates more effective campaigns, and builds an inbound machine filled with great prospects.
* **Sales** understands marketing’s *who* and *how*, but is also armed with a cheat code that helps them thrive in any competitive conversation they encounter.
* **Product** gets a clearer understanding of your advantage in the eyes of your customers (as opposed to their minds) and doubles down on what buyers care about most and can make smart investment and roadmap decisions.

Without a solid differentiated foundation, you and your teams suffer from:

* **Confusion**: What exactly does your company offer that’s special and why do customers care?
* **Low-confidence:** How do we talk about our product and business? Are these campaigns and talk tracks likely to work? What do we build? Who do we pursue?
* **Second-guessing and bad suggestions:** Without doing the hard work of figuring out how you're unique and valuable (i.e. differentiated), every mediocre idea gets considered, every good idea is prone to second-guessing. You waste time, energy, and enthusiasm.

You need to do the work to set a foundation and execute.

The good news: None of the above is that difficult to overcome. With a little knowledge of your competitors, product, and customers, you can create great differentiated messaging. 

All it takes is the right framework and some time.

**A few useful definitions:** 

* **Differentiator:**A characteristic of your firm that separates you from key competitors and gives you a perceived advantage in the eyes of your target customers
   * Key Elements: 
      * Entire firm, not just the product
      * Key competitors, not every competitor
      * Customer focus  
* **Messaging:**The key concepts you want a prospect to know about your company. What do you provide? How do you provide it? What value do customers receive? Messaging is the foundation that supports effective marketing, copywriting, campaigns, sales conversations, and more.  
* **Differentiated Messaging:**This is the unique message and story that only you can tell because of the product and company you’ve built and customers you serve. It tells prospects how you’re uniquely valuable to them and how you alone can help achieve a particular outcome. Differentiated messaging should be your marketing team’s holy grail and first priority before writing a website, one-pager, case study, or any other piece of collateral.

**Step 1: Get Smart**

You’re going to have a very hard time telling a compelling story about your business if you don’t understand your product, customers, and competitors, which are the Core Components of Differentiated Messaging.Founders *sometimes* know their product, customers, and competitors well enough to proceed straight to Step 2, but there are plenty of founders who have understandably confused themselves about who they serve well and why. They’re too in the weeds to be effective marketers. 

Other leaders — CMOs, sales and product leaders, and product marketers — will need to partner across teams to make sure they’ve got the requisite knowledge to have a fruitful discussion.The idea is to know each of the Core Components as a team. A single individual doesn’t need all of this knowledge, but across a team, you need to know product, customers, and competitors. 

In general you should know (or get to know) your:

* Customers: 
   * Firmographics: What types of businesses have you sold to in the past? Consider industry, team size and composition, revenue, geography, tech stack, and customer base. This will help you develop a hypothesis about which potential segments you serve best.
   * Buyers: Who within a firm do you sell to most often? What persona? Who else is in the buyer map?
   * Problems: What problems are the companies you serve facing? What are they trying to accomplish?
   * Why you: The most difficult question to answer accurately is why customers chose you. Your sales conversations should give you an idea about why a customer chose you, but you may need to circle back and ask again. A decent win-loss program really helps here.

* Product: 
   * Features: You may have a technical product with a long list of features. It’s possible that 1-2 of these are a key differentiator.
   * Non-Product Attributes: While we tend to focus on features in technology, it’s likely that your customers value some other aspect of your firm. The sales experience, delivery channel, customer service, industry expertise, and more are all possible differentiation factors. So while the product gets the most attention, be sure to think beyond the software.  
* Competitors: 
   * It’s easy to go too deep on your competitors. You can easily consider too many competitors and think too much about their features, customers, investors, marketing and more. Instead, focus on the three competitors you see most often in deals, and focus on their marketing. Limit your research here competitors’ websites and five most recent blog posts and press releases. You’ll need to consume this marketing with a critical eye. Look for what they’re saying and *what they’re not saying*.

**Step 2: Structured Workshop With Your Team**

This is the crux.

Of the three steps, this workshop is the one that has the biggest potential impact. If done well you’ll surface useful disagreements, compelling insights, unique perspectives, and come to consensus on what matters most. It uncovers facts, drives alignment, and helps win buy-in, all of which are keys to a successful messaging project.

I use a framework called MUD, which I learned from a very smart colleague. MUD is an acronym for:

* Meaningful: Can we charge money for this attribute?
* Unique: Do we alone offer it? Can our target customers get the same thing elsewhere?
* Defensible: Can we prove what we claim with data or testimonials?

Here’s the workshop process:

1. **Discuss potential differentiators as a group**This isn’t quite a brainstorm, but it is a broad discussion about your business and customers. You want to encourage people to consider the business broadly and think beyond mere product features — remember the elements of a differentiator in the definition above.You’ll notice the same ideas surfacing again and again from slightly different angles, with slightly different emphases. That’s great! Let the ideas and opinions flow during this portion of the discussion. That said, it’s helpful if you can combine similar ideas to points that have already been made, as it makes subsequent steps easier. An experienced facilitator can really help here.Depending on your product and market, you should generate a list of 10-30 potential differentiators.  
2. **Evaluate based on MUD**With a list of 20-30 potential differentiators in hand, you then evaluate them based on the MUD framework.Go down your list and ask yourselves if each is Meaningful (will someone pay for this attribute), Unique (you alone offer it), and Defensible (can you prove it). Be very honest. The temptation to fudge is strong, especially when you’re discussing Uniqueness, but being soft here will hurt in the long run. Again, an experienced facilitator can help you navigate tough questions and commit to ideas with promise.The MUD process should hone your imprecise list of 20-30 potential differentiators down to 3-5 well-articulated, high-quality attributes that you can share confidently with your team, prospects, and customers.

**Step 3: Refine results to craft a compelling story**

A workshop alone won’t lead to clear and compelling differentiators. You’ll need a team of articulate colleagues to make your differentiators shine and to highlight the value that each delivers. Spend time with a colleague or two to refine what you created in the workshop and highlight the value each delivers for your target customers.You should seek to use each of your differentiators as a pillar that supports a compelling story about your customer, product, and market. And that story should lead customers directly to one solution … yours.

1hbsxn7,Are you pivoting after a negative pitch?,"Hi all,

so my co founder and me (I am the IT guy) just had our first real pitch to a potential pilot customer. We are working on a platform where users are able to buy services. The niche is not very digital yet. 
So we presented our idea and he said that it will not work because they will always use the payment and redemption options in their existing POS provider. They are also working on some local apps to have it more digital and don't need an overall platform, because we will not be able to onboard all other businesses. 
So we are asking ourselves now if we need to pivot on some main features or not. Our app will be much better for the enduser, but if we don't have businesses on our platform it will not help. An integration to the POS systems would be great, but to expensive at the beginning. We wanted to handle the payments here and redeem the products via QR Codes in the beginning. I still think we have a great solution, but he said we should change the area for our business.

So are you pivoting some features after every feedback or do you evaluate the feedback and then continue working on the general product? 

Thanks,

1hbrl60,3 Key Elements of a High-Converting Web App MVP 🚀,"As someone who builds MVPs as a part of my daily job, I’ve learned a lot about what works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to creating impactful web applications. Here are three things I always keep in mind:

1️⃣ **Simplicity is Key:** Your MVP isn’t meant to be feature-packed. Focus on the **core problem** you’re solving and implement just enough functionality to validate your idea. Adding too many features early can overwhelm users and delay launch.

2️⃣ **User Feedback Drives Growth:** The first version isn’t perfect—and it shouldn’t be. Launch early, then use **real feedback from users** to guide the next steps. Tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics can help you understand user behavior.

3️⃣ **Landing Pages Matter:** Your app is only half the battle. A clear, well-designed landing page with strong CTAs can significantly improve conversions. Highlight the benefits over features, and keep the design clean to avoid cognitive overload. A Good looking landing page &amp; a high conversion landing page are two diff things.

If you’re a founder working on an idea or struggling with getting your MVP to market, feel free to share your challenges in the comments. I’d be happy to brainstorm ideas or offer advice. Let’s help each other build something great!

1hbz0xm,Worth Building this SAAS?,"I'm working on a SAAS which takes your content and localizes it, this includes translation with lipsyncing, using your own voice for dubbing etc.. as well as channel creation and automatic uploading. So you can link your youtube channel, select ""Spanish"" and the channel will be created and automatically go through the localization and uploading process every time you upload to your main channel, hence expanding your viewership/brand/revenue.

This will be available for Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter etc..

The main pushback against this is product is that Youtube is starting to add an ""Audio Track"" setting that enables automatic dubbing for your channel. The problem with relying solely on this Youtube feature for localization is that

1. It's being rolled out slowly and only available for a small amount of creators.
2. Even when dubbing is added it's unnatural because of the unsynced lips
3. Dubbing takes away the personal connection you create with your actual voice/brand recognition and uses a generic sound that is probably assigned to every other channel.
4. This may be incorrect but I've read that mixing your channel demographics from different countries can lower the ad rates for US based channels which have the highest rate. So if users start watching dubbed spanish and your main user base starts to shift from the US to say Brazil, then the revenue you generate will start decreasing opposed to keeping a purely US based rate.
5. While other platforms may start to push out dubbing sometime soon, right now only Youtube has just started to do it and trying to implement the other features such as using your own voice for dubbing at the scale Youtube has to deal with will be nearly impossible for a long time.

1hbkqyi,Llama is better? My client insists on Claude for building an AI Agent,"I’m working on a project where I need to build an AI agent for a client. As someone who has evaluated different models, I genuinely believe LLaMA (especially its recent iterations) is better for the job. Here’s why:
	1.	Customization: LLaMA is open-weight, which means I have far greater flexibility to fine-tune and tailor it for the specific use case. This level of control is perfect for creating a specialized agent.
	2.	Cost-Efficiency: Hosting LLaMA locally or on dedicated infrastructure can save significantly in the long term compared to relying on Claude’s API pricing structure.
	3.	Performance: Depending on the task, LLaMA has shown better accuracy and reasoning capabilities in many benchmarks. It also has a more robust architecture for handling nuanced instructions when properly fine-tuned.
	4.	Privacy: Since LLaMA can run on custom infrastructure, I can ensure data security and privacy, which is a big concern for many businesses these days.

However, my client is adamant about using Claude. I get it—it’s user-friendly, has a solid API, and works great out of the box for many general-purpose applications. But I feel like Claude’s closed ecosystem and less customizable nature might limit the long-term potential of the AI agent we’re building.

Am I wrong for pushing back on this? Has anyone else faced a similar situation where the client insists on a tool that you know isn’t the best fit? Would love to hear your thoughts on navigating this!

1hbbna8,Marketing organically is insanely hard and burning me out,"UK-based

I have a tech background and have blasted through building an MVP/prototype that shows off my idea concept, it took about 5 weeks. I'm trying to build interest and 75% of the time people respond positively (if they reply),  A handful of people have reached out asking to try it free of charge and but I haven't received any feedback yet. I have been reaching out to people via LinkedIn private messaging and reddit forums.

My idea is healthcare-related and I get the impression that many people in the industry are just overworked and don't have time nor motivation to try out my solution. They need an incentive, I am basically saying ""*hey, I made a thing, please can you try it for me AND let me know what you think for free???*"", it is a shock to me that people are even saying yes to this.

I don't know how to give that incentive to them without scaling the product, but then it would be foolish to scale a product that hasn't been validated, no?

I am currently unemployed and working on this full time and the lack of traction I am getting from marketing has been way more frustrating than I expected - when I was building I felt total control over how fast the project was moving and more alive than ever. Now I feel like I am frozen, and I am beating myself up over what feels like a huge lack of progress.

I would love some guidance, are there any angles I can take here? I have budget for advertising, I was thinking that I could create a landing page to gauge interest and then email the people who sign up personally instead of hoping they'll get back to me.

1hbux45,I’ve built an AI website builder and it’s free to use,"
So, at the start of this year, I had the idea to develop a free website builder for small business owners using Al, saving them months of stress and thousands in design costs.

Brands such as Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace are great, but they still required a certain level of skill to use and also took a decent amount of time to complete a website. We realised most business owners don't have this time and definitely didn't want to spend thousands on a new website. 

Our mission was to put an end on this completely.

So, we developed an AI website builder which we believe is the best in the market (after testing and paying attention to others)

Here’s how the platform works:
- AI does the heavy lifting: use it to design unlimited amounts of websites in seconds, or choose from 200+ professionally designed templates. 
- Not confident with tech? No worries, you can schedule a free 1-on-1 website setup call where we’ll design the website for you. (Basically, you’re getting a free web designer- no stress or hidden fees)
- Plus, our websites are easy to manage, you can do any updates yourself, anytime, without paying a penny more. And we have an online course with answers to all topics. 

This AI website builder has been developed all year and we’re now wanting more people to test it out for themselves, and to also gauge the interest from people - although we did reach 6K followers from pre launch ads! (Humble brag)

Right now, we’re working with service based businesses only, as we don’t want to burden ourselves with e-commerce functionality at the start, although we do have this as an option, it just requires some extra coding.

If you’re wondering how we’re offering this service for free, our platform offers website hosting and we also have a marketing agency so developing these connections will only help us work with the next big upcoming businesses. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
- Does this sound like something you or a small business owner you know would use?
- What features would make a platform like this a no brainer for you?
- Any feedback on the concept or launch strategy?

If you’re curious to see how it works, just drop me a message - happy to arrange a call or I can share the website if you want to test it out for yourself.

Looking forward to your thoughts and advice! I’m here to learn from the community and improve where I can. ",0,startups,1733928027.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbux45/ive_built_an_ai_website_builder_and_its_free_to/

We're a B2C startup that just surpassed $12k MRR, bootstrapped, and we're also doing a spinoff - a B2B product that grew from a personal pain point we experienced while growing our B2C business through SEO. We have some early traction with B2B, but B2C remains our primary source of revenue.

We've also raised a very small FFF round to accelerate our growth. We're a very small team at the moment, just two brothers as co-founders. I'm the CEO/CTO, technical, write code and sell, with lots of experience from working at YC and big tech. My brother is non-technical, a CPO/CMO blend, responsible for marketing, product, operations, and customer support. We also have two hired people: a content marketer and a software engineer.

Our blind spots are structure, project management, and strategy. We all hate routine and project management. I feel a need for someone to step into a role to help us ""get organized.""

A friend of mine organically approached us and made himself useful on several fronts. He helped us think through our goals and financial projections.

We also get along very well (I've known him for 10 years now but never worked on any substantial project together). He's also remote. I'm in SF, my brother's in Warsaw, and he's in Amsterdam.

Now we want to make a decision about whether to make him an offer as a co-founder. Help me think this through. Here are the questions I've asked myself so far:

1. Would this person increase the probability of success for this company? Yes, I think he will. But maybe if I looked more intentionally, I'd find someone who would accelerate us even faster. I'm not sure.
2. Can I hire this person? No, I can't. His salary is north of $300k yearly, and we wouldn't be able to afford that.
3. Are his skills complementary to ours? Yes, he has much better presentation skills than anyone in our group. He also has a PhD, which looks good on paper and will attract better talent.
4. Do we get along? Yes, I feel comfortable in his presence and would love to hang out together.

His role would be something like chief of staff, plus he could help with engineering.

Now, I know this is a lot of words, but what questions should I ask myself before making him a co-founder or deciding otherwise?",4,startups,1733865216.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbch7r/do_we_need_a_cofounder_or_an_employee/
1hb7bu8,Should I Quit My Job to Pursue My Startup Idea?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads and could really use some advice. I work as an staff applied research scientist in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and during my job, I’ve identified a significant problem in the process of data generation for RAG systems. I’ve come up with an idea that I believe can solve this problem effectively—not just for my current company but for any organization that relies on document-based systems.

Here’s the situation:
- The idea is not specific to my company; it’s a general solution that could benefit various industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.

- I haven’t built anything yet, but I’ve started planning the product and am confident it could work.

- My current employment contract likely restricts me from working on side projects without disclosure.

I’m torn between two options:
- Stay at my job and work on the idea as a side project: This would allow me to validate the idea without taking a big financial risk. However, it feels slow, and I’m concerned about any potential conflict with my employer.

- Quit my job and go all-in on the startup: This would give me the freedom to focus entirely on the idea, but it’s a big leap, and I’d need to rely on my savings until the startup gains traction.

For context:
- I have savings to support myself (single no kids) for a 1 year.

- I’m passionate about solving this problem and feel this idea has real potential.

- I want to act ethically and ensure I’m not violating any legal agreements.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I quit my job and take the risk, or try to balance both until the idea gains traction?

1hbnnwg,How to Crush Facebook Ads with a Small Budget,"Running Facebook ads successfully with a small budget is not only possible but often recommended for new advertisers. Starting small allows you to minimize financial risk while learning the platform and optimizing campaigns. Here's a step-by-step guide to maximizing results on a tight budget.

# Defining a Small Budget

* **Small Budget**: Less than $3,300 per month (\~$100/day).
* **Tiny Budget**: Less than $600 per month (\~$20/day).

Starting small is wise because initial campaigns might not perform well. Once profitable, you can scale confidently.

# 1. Copy What Works Best in Your Industry

With limited funds, avoid testing too many variables. Instead:

* Use the **Meta Ads Library** (free tool) to analyze competitors' ads.
* Focus on ads that have been running for months; these are likely successful.
* Model your ads on these examples, including style, format, and language, but avoid outright copying.

Shortcut your success by leveraging others' testing efforts.

# 2. Reduce the Number of Variables

* Focus on selling **one product or service** at a time, preferably:
   * Your best-selling item.
   * The item with the highest profit margin.
* Keep campaigns simple with fewer ad sets and ads.

This approach helps Meta gather sufficient data and optimizes performance faster.

# 3. Trust Meta’s Algorithms

Rely on tools like **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns** or **Advantage+ Audiences** to let Meta optimize targeting and placement. Avoid experimental tactics that could risk your small budget.

Meta’s systems are designed to deliver results, especially when campaigns align with platform recommendations.

# 4. Be Willing to Spend More on Conversions

Set realistic expectations for return on ad spend (ROAS):

* For beginners, aiming for a **2x–4x ROAS** is reasonable.
* Aggressively spend up to your break-even point to gain initial customers.

The goal is not immediate profitability but scaling, gathering conversion data, and building brand awareness for long-term success.

# 5. Avoid Brand Awareness Campaigns

For small budgets:

* Focus on **lead generation** or **sales campaigns**.
* Avoid vague objectives like ""getting your business out there.""

Exception: **Omnipresent content strategies** can work for small audiences but are niche-specific.

# 6. Avoid Constantly Tweaking Campaigns

Frequent adjustments reset the **learning phase**, hindering optimization. To maximize success:

* Allow campaigns to run for a sufficient period to gather data.
* Adjust based on **conversion volume**, not arbitrary timeframes.

Smaller budgets mean longer learning phases, so patience is key.

# 7. Niche Down Your Audience

Target a specific subsection of your market to:

* Tailor messaging effectively.
* Stand out from generic ads targeting broad audiences.

For example, instead of marketing broadly, position yourself as a specialist in a specific industry, like SaaS businesses. Expand gradually as you scale.

# 8. Embrace New Features and Strategies

Leverage your small business agility by quickly adopting:

* New Meta features.
* Innovative ad strategies.

Larger companies often move slower due to complex decision-making processes, giving smaller advertisers a competitive advantage.

# Conclusion

Running Facebook ads with a small budget requires strategic planning and patience. By focusing on what works, trusting Meta’s tools, and avoiding common pitfalls, you can achieve success and scale your campaigns over time. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your results grow.",0,startups,1733899607.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbnnwg/how_to_crush_facebook_ads_with_a_small_budget/
1hbsldk,this is how i got 15k signups in 24hrs ,"i made a post 3 months ago about an idea i had last year around and how it received traction of 13k in the waitlist but failed to build a team and raise to get it going. well in the past 24 hrs, i got another project **100k visits, 80k submissions, 15k signups, and 24k affiliate clicks in 24 hrs** on a pretty basic idea. im not here to promote the product or the project but talk about marketing and execution as whole especially with $0 marketing budget. we would be breaking even in the end, mby slight profit but it was never meant to be a money maker, more so marketing project to bring ppl to the platform.

my cofounder and i are 2-man team. he is the tech and i am the marketing/growth. i came up with the idea last week, pitched it to him, he built it in 2 days, and we dropped it. no posts on reddit, no paid ads, no influencers or creators, just by asking and making friends. our goal for this specific project is to grow and build a community around it. it aint gonna make us millions but what's valuable is the platform and users we'll be able to reach.

here are few tips to tech founders who lack marketing and sales:

\- build a brand or build a persona online but have a presence

\- interact with soon to be users/customers ahead of time but don't give off corporate/sales vibes, make friends

\- build relationships with your users ahead of time, months ahead ideally but weeks works.

\- always ask, the worst thing a person can say is ""no"", don't be afraid of rejection or being ignored or ghosted

these tips would be your generic tips for any startup, depending on the industry and audience, u'd have to think outside the box.

1hbn3hx,Idea Validation - Ever spent hours wrestling with data from a PDF or invoice? ,"You know the drill: someone sends you a file, and suddenly it’s *your job* to extract all the data manually. Copy-pasting, fixing formatting issues, and double-checking everything. By the time you’re done, you’re wondering why it felt like such a monumental waste of time.

I’ve been there. And honestly? It’s what inspired me to start building a solution.

Here’s the idea:  
Imagine a tool where you can upload *any* document—PDFs, invoices, contracts, whatever—and it extracts all the important data into a clean, editable table in seconds no OCR training effort required, you just tell what you want to extract regardless of the format and it does it for you.

But that’s not all. You could:

* Edit or add custom notes/fields right there.
* Automate the next steps (send data to your CRM, shoot off an email, etc.).
* Validate data through a custom API or save it directly into your database.

Basically, it’s about turning that painful grunt work into an automated workflow. No coding. No headaches. Just fast, clean data you can actually use.

Now, I would like to validate the idea, how do you guys feel about this?

1hbdfhb,5 ways content marketing has changed over the last decade,"I've been in the digital marketing game since 2010, mostly focusing on startups and e-commerce. As I've been prepping to launch a new project, it’s striking just how much the industry has changed over the last decade—and how few of the tactics I would have employed in 2015 are even remotely relevant today.

And since one of my core marketing skills has always been wasting time on Reddit, I thought I’d put some of my thoughts together in a post to see if this tracks with other folks’ experiences.

Here are five ways I’ve seen content marketing evolve over the last decade. What did I miss?

**1. Organic social reach for written content has collapsed**

One of the first startups I worked with built a sizable audience on Facebook simply by creating and sharing fun, engaging blog content. At its peak, this company could post an intriguing blog link and consistently count on tens of thousands of clicks without spending any money on boosting it at all. This was the era of BuzzFeed quizzes, endless listicles, and content designed—for better or worse— to appease the clickbait gods.

But in the mid-to-late 2010s, Facebook introduced changes that completely killed this strategy. Organic reach for links was throttled, while content that kept users on the platform (like videos and native posts) was rewarded. Look up the infamous “pivot to video” for an illustration of how this impacted media brands. For more check out Cory Doctorow’s concept of “enshittification,” a pattern that continues to today.

**2. SEO Is more competitive, niche, and less gameable**

When I first started in marketing, the SEO playbook was riddled with black-hat tactics: keyword stuffing, low-effort link farms, duplicate sites—you name it. But then Google got hip and rolled out a series of algorithm updates that penalized low-quality tactics. Some clients I worked with lost half their SEO traffic overnight as various core algo updates rolled out.

Since then, Google has continued to bang the drum that all it wants is high-quality, useful content that fills the needs of the person searching. Of course, this is not a bad thing, and in-depth, original, and niche content that truly addresses search intent should be rewarded. What's challenging is that over this same period, it's become increasingly difficult to ""win"" at SEO as Google has stuffed its SERPs with ads and new features like those recent AI summaries. SEO remains one of the only viable content channels for startups, but in many ways, it's more competitive and more difficult than ever.

**3. Mobile-first everything**

Even the most professional UX designers (working as they do from their 27-inch monitors) can forget that most web traffic comes from mobile devices. It’s no longer enough for your site to be mobile-friendly—it has to be mobile-first. This has been as much of a change for marketers as it has been for devs and designers. After all, the experience that someone has when landing on mobile page can make or break every one of your marketing metrics and channels.  

**4. The ascent of vertical video**

If you're reading this, than you already know that the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels has fundamentally reshaped content consumption. Vertical video has become the dominant format, and its influence extends far beyond these platforms. Since these apps are more about keeping users on the app than driving them to external links. This shift forces marketers to rethink how they approach content creation. Instead of using social media as a referral engine, it’s all about building brand awareness and engaging directly with audiences. And even this has already started to become more difficult (see again, ""enshittification"").

**5. The AI revolution (and/or apocalypse)**

Finally, there’s the six-fingered elephant in the room: AI. The rise of tools like ChatGPT et al has already transformed content marketing workflows with new AI-driven tools cropping up every day. While we’re still in the early days of the AI revolution, it’s clear that this isn’t just a fad. AI will continue to reshape how marketers create, distribute, and measure content. I mean, I bet people are reading this post right now who think that it's AI-generated (I swear, it's not though I did use GPT to proofread).

I posted in r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, but also going to drop updates here as well. I wouldn't call us an ""indie hacker"" team because I'm not a one man show, but we're not ""funded"".

1haw07b,Anyone else here have autism / auditory processing disorder (APD) and find going to parties and networking hard?,"I moved back to the bay area from CO primarily because I wanted to do another startup in the AI space.

The problem is I really forgot how much I hate networking and going to parties.

I also have auditory processing disorder (APD) which makes it much harder for me to have discussions in rooms when music is playing or lots of people are taking.

It effectively makes going to super cool events almost pointless to me.

Now I LOVE talking to smart people so if I can hear them I really enjoy it but it's usually in smaller meetings or when people are outside.  

The problem is that this is most of the events I go to.  It's just such a cacophony I can't really focus and just want to leave.

I thought maybe one strategy would be to organize my OWN events that I design to be ideal for me to hear. Like going for hikes or over dinner. Something like that.

1hbdz5s,$5.. forever? 😏,"👋🏼 Over the past year, I’ve been diving into software development and product management. Most of my projects have been ambitious and complex (read: nowhere near finished), so I decided to tackle something smaller to gain practical experience.

Recently, I needed to organize my finances for an upcoming move. Instead of creating yet another Google Sheet, I thought, Why not build a simple tool for myself? 🙃

What began as a quick personal project quickly escalated. In just a few days, I developed a full app, complete with a licensing system and a (barebones) marketing site. It’s been a fun learning journey, and it feels great to have something tangible out there instead of endlessly tinkering.

The app is straightforward—it’s an offline finance tool that stores data locally and helps plan finances without relying on bank integrations. While it’s not groundbreaking, it serves my needs and avoids the hassle of dealing with miscategorized transactions.

Here’s where I deviated from the norm: I opted for a $5 lifetime license instead of the typical subscription model. I understand that subscriptions are standard in SaaS, and this approach likely won’t make me rich. However, I wanted to experiment with simplicity and see if a one-time price could still attract interest.

So far, a few sales have come in, boosting my confidence. But I’m curious: Does this kind of pricing make sense for small, low-maintenance tools like this? Or am I missing the mark by not adopting the subscription model?

I've noticed a lot of sales/CRM platforms work primarily on sales funnel and conversions; mostly to close deals. But I've been looking for 'post sales', basically making sure customers onboard properly, use the products the right way etc. I've worked in the past with a couple of larger, more mature startups who predominantly went with enterprise level customers and they're using jury-rigged CRMs to manage those relationships. So they make sure they're touching base with them and they essentially create new 'pipelines' and triggers to check in with a customer if they haven't in a while or if the customer makes a certain action.

I've found what I've been looking at is essentially account management and customer success, but there doesn't appear to many tools specifically for this area.

My product is way better than anything that currently exists in the market.

1hafrv8,Your thoughts on fractional CXOs?,"I was a startup CTO (and co-founder) but after a long 8 year grind I decided to step down. Main reason: the company entered a new phase with main focus on sales and scaling with much less innovation. Came to a point where I simply felt done and started to hate my job.

Took the company from 0 to 1 and grew product and engineering teams from 3 to 40 people. After stepping down I got a handful of offers from other startups but politely declined and took a well-needed sabbatical. Wasn't mentally ready to commit to a new journey just yet. A fellow CTO friend suggested that I try consulting as Fractional CTO. Loved the idea and the flexibility but quickly noticed that the majority of smaller and early-stage startups had tiny budgets and were looking for a lead engineer and not a CTO. While I do love to code I also love to lead people and build teams and culture. 

I understand that you can't bring in a fractional CTO if your company already has a CTO but I also see many in this sub looking for a technical co-founder. In my head, a fractional CTO is the perfect candidate. It's the least risky way to try work together and see if there is personal chemistry and vibe. If we enjoy working together and I believe in the idea I would even strongly consider joining the team if offered. 

On to my question:

I am still figuring out my ICP and where to find the right people (Linkedin sucks ) and wanted to ask people here what their views on fractionals are in general. Have you worked with any? In what phase? If not, did you consider it? Why not?

Please share your honest thoughts, experiences, and of course, opinions!

Thoughts on this idea for a student ticket p2p


is is an (albeit not very original) small idea I've had over the past day, looking to see if it would be viable on a small scale.

Essentially, I'm a college student that's noticed that the ticket market is kinda fucked for alot of students, particularly for reselling and ticket exchanges, students often have to go through WhatsApp in groups, there are alot of scams, and it's not very secure.

the central idea of this is a student-centred p2p marketplace to buy, sell and exchange tickets for (mainly) student events. It could potentially partner with different student groups and societies on campuses, exclusive pre-sale access, possibly local venue partnerships as well, for student discounts of early-bird pricing. There would be price-caps to prevent extreme scalping, and two-factor authenticators using student ID to keep out fraudulent activity.

Revenue generation could come from a small transaction fees, subscription plans, advertising etc. 

There are alot of different ticket apps out there right now, what sets this idea apart is the focus on students and alleviate their specific pain-points. what do you think?",0,startups,1733787955.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hao27x/thoughts_on_this_idea_for_a_studentfocused_ticket/

I have been working at a startup for a couple of months as the founding engineer brought on. Our MVP has been built and started making money but there are no outside investors currently. I have done a significant amount of work on the backend for free due to having a personal relationship with one of the founders and it's more fun than my day job. I am trying to figure out what my expectations should be for equity now that the legal papers are finished.

We are currently bootstrapped and unsure if investors will be needed. The current equity situation has 25% designated for employees and investors - they want to give me 5-6% because they say that investors will be unlikely to invest if given more equity than this and that 5-6% is already triple the market value for equity for an employee (if we had any money to give me a salary as well).

I feel like because I am working for free and will probably be working for free for the next months / year currently that I should be in the range of 10-15%, but I got the sense that they thought this was unreasonable.

1hamrkm,startup ios name advice,"for context im building an ios app in a niche area and i came up with a pretty creative and name that i love - it’s directly related to the niche im building and its a simple but memorable name.

the only problem is that there is someone else in the same niche space who had a similar idea to me with the same name on the App Store. they seem like a small builder with a history of making two apps, but the app im talking about only has 2 reviews for stars and hasn’t been updated in over a year.

even though i am in the same space as the other app and planned to use the name in a fun unique way like the other app, my apps execution is completely different from design to function (even though they address the same problem)

im not that worried about the other app impacting my new apps search because even the other app doesn’t show up in the top 3 for its name - so if people love what I build im hoping my search results will be much better

my main issue right now is that I’ve fallen in love with the name. I came up with it when I first was building the app and now im really really disappointed a very small outdated app has the same one.

I know names don’t mean everything but this one I felt meant a lot as a ios app where the name is also tied to the meaning and ways to market / distribute the app.

there’s no trademark on the name I checked - would you recommend me still using the same name? I know apple has a strict policy but im hoping my execution and actual final product being much better and unique can be enough (especially since the other app hasn’t been updated or used much)

1ha6q7c,"Story about ""re-starting"" successful startup","I have been working on a startup related to 3D printer management. Over the last few years, this segment has changed a lot—new competitors have appeared, and we’re slowly achieving nice numbers in terms of users and new subscriptions.

A year ago, we realized that instead of focusing on creating precise solutions to integrate all 3D printers into our software, the real focus should be on the process itself—the workflow of how 3D models are created and prepared for printing. We always thought we needed to create an end-to-end solution, from the moment the 3D model is created to the time the printer starts working. But this is an incredibly complex problem as a whole, and not all parts of it need solving.

Our biggest target group right now is schools, where the process begins in the classroom with students and their projects. They create a model, send it for review to the teacher, schedule it for printing alongside others, and finally, it gets printed. Interestingly, the last part—the actual printing, which is the most difficult from a ""technical"" perspective—is the least important in the process.

We tried to implement all these steps into our application, but in the end, we built a very complex piece of software that didn’t solve the most critical parts of the workflow.

With all this in mind, I decided to leave this startup and start a new one, bringing with me all the experience and new perspectives I’ve gained. This time, I’m starting from the beginning—thinking before coding. I’m trying to adhere to all the concepts I know exist, but as someone ""over-experienced,"" I sometimes skipped steps in the past. Now, I’m learning to share my ideas publicly, I’ve created a ""signup waitlist"" page for my new startup, and I’m genuinely excited to see how things unfold.

This time, I want to truly enjoy the startup journey. I feel like I have more space, time, and the opportunity to do things properly. And who knows—maybe in the future, my ""old startup"" will evolve into the new one, solving old problems from a fresh perspective.

I just wanted to share this mindset change. It’s been incredibly liberating to leave behind the ""full bag"" that was weighing me down and embrace this ""light running.""",7,startups,1733739748.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ha6q7c/story_about_restarting_successful_startup/

I can see it being necessary to keep on some of the engineers to perform maintenance, train other staff, incorporate into the other company.  

The reason I’m asking this is because I’m trying to help understand how our current sass company can position itself for acquisition. My CEO seems to think that having the **potential** to solve more market problems (eg by leveraging the current platform, and because the team has a history of some innovative solutions) is something valuable.  Me on the other hand, I feel like the current platform with all his current abilities, is what the only real value that any potential buyer would care about.

1h9v6dj,Technical founder here - What's your take on outsourcing MVP development? How much would you pay?,"

Hey fellow founders,

As a technical founder who's been in the startup ecosystem for a while, I've noticed a significant rise in MVP development agencies. While I can code, I've been wondering about the general sentiment around outsourcing MVP development, especially given time constraints and the need to focus on other aspects of the business.

I'm curious:

1. Would you consider hiring someone to build your MVP, even as a technical founder? Why or why not?

2. The big question - what's your threshold for MVP development cost? What would you consider a reasonable budget for a solid MVP? (I'm seeing ranges from $5K to $50K+ and honestly not sure what's reasonable anymore)

Would love to hear from those who've gone this route:
- What did you pay?
- Was it worth it?
- Any regrets?

Also, if you chose NOT to outsource, I'd love to hear your reasoning.

P.S. Not looking to outsource right now, just trying to understand the market dynamics and what other founders think is a fair price point for MVP development.",47,startups,1733698334.0,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9v6dj/technical_founder_here_whats_your_take_on/
1hanls4,"Our New Facebook Ads Strategy that made us 7.5 ROAS
","Dude this was crazy!  
  
This is how we've been consistently generating 5-10 ultra qualified. leads per day for our SaaS using facebook ads and conditional logic  
  
We used to struggle because our ads tend to attract a lot of ""wannabe entrepreneurs"" that would sign up then cancel the next month because their business wasn't running yet  
  
Now we attract only people that already have a running business and are looking for a better tool to do their everyday priority tasks  
  
**First - The Ad creatives**  
  
You know, your Saas should be a better alternative to a pre-existing method of executing an everyday task   
  
The idea is: your customer needs to execute a few tasks everyday that are essential for the business to run  
  
Simple example: the uber driver has to drive towards the clients pickup spot  
  
Your Saas should be a superior tool when compared to the traditional method (example: chainsaw vs. hacksaw)  
  
Your facebook ad creative should be a video announcing the viewer that your tool exists and that you're capable of performing XYZ tasks faster and/or cheaper. That's it.  
  
Try to use an instagram Reel format.   
  
**Second - The ad form**  
  
Our biggest shift here was to use facebook's native form.  
  
We plugged it into a google sheets spreadsheet and the form answers  come automatically into the spreadsheet.  
  
But what changed it all was using the ""conditional logic"" feature.  
  
Basically, when you turn it on, you can choose one or more questions that will define an answer as ""qualified"" or not.  
  
So now facebook will only consider those types of answers as an actual ""lead"".  
  
**THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING**  
  
Last month we spent 4k in ads and generated 30k in revenue.  
  
This month we managed to reduce the cost per lead to 1/3rd, plus we doubled our daily ad spend so we're excited for that.  
  
That was only possible due to the increase in lead quality that allowed us to have 24k paid in fulls (2 year contract)   
  
Facebook's native lead form also allowed👉 us to have cheaper leads without losing quality of leads.   
👉I suspect this happened because when the traffic goes to your website facebook have a hard time to track it, but with the native lead form, this is no problem since the traffic is still in facebook.  
  
So recap:  
  
\- your ad creative should attack the inferior alternative to your Saas product  
\- use facebook's native form with the conditional logic turned ON  
\- get Rich

1hacs3q,Finding investors for consumer app,"
Hi,

I'm a technical founder (incorporated) for a new friend and date-finding app launching in Vancouver, Canada. Before you roll your eyes, I want to say that this is near and dear to my heart. So much so that I want to change the industry by offering the most important features for free and significantly undercut popular apps. There will be in-app purchases, yes. But I want to give the people the tools they need to find what they are looking for.

The MVP for iOS and Android is 70% done, and now I'm looking for potential investors to get this off the ground. The expensive part will be chat and database fees, as well as initial marketing in Vancouver (where it will be launched first), to make people aware of the app.

I'm new to all this, and I've learned a lot. But I have no clue how to find and approach people with money, that want to invest in a b2c app.

I would appreciate any tips, contacts, etc. Slide deck available. 

Thanks.

Sorry posting this again as the last got deleted.   
  
So, I’ve been toying with this idea of creating a dating app. I feel like the ones out there haven’t really brought anything new to the table in a while, and I’m wondering if 2025 could be the year to shake things up.

* Are people still into dating apps? Or has the hype died down?
* Do younger folks still trust apps to find connections, or has that shifted?
* What do you think is missing from the current apps? Something that would actually make dating online less… frustrating?

Also, if anyone out there is interested in building something different with me, hit me up. I think there’s potential to create something fresh, but I’d love to hear from people who’d want to collaborate.

1h9kdd2,Gross Revenue Sharing? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all doing well.   
  
A few months ago, I was researching effective ways to distribute revenue to early business partners in a startup. Specifically, I explored methods like compensating people with equity instead of a salary. During my research though, I found that many individuals who chose to accept equity over a salary in various startups later regretted their decision. A common reason was that some founders often found creative ways to avoid paying dividends. I came across this issue repeatedly through blogs and videos shared by people who experienced it firsthand.   
  
And even if the founders are trustworthy, a late-stage investor with a majority share could intentionally structure the company's finances to ensure profits are funneled toward their own interests, so that early contributors are left with nothing.

After doing some more research, however, I discovered this amazing thing called 'Gross Revenue Sharing'. Gross revenue sharing is a contractual agreement where payouts are based on the gross revenue—the total income a company earns before any expenses are deducted—rather than profits made. 

For example, an agreement might stipulate that if you work for the company for a specific period (say, five years) and meet a clear set of predetermined goals year after year, you will receive a fixed percentage of gross revenue (e.g., 0.001%) annually for the next 50 years(or whatever other number of years would be fair). This ensures a guaranteed reward that is not subject to potentially manipulated profit margins.

This way seems much safer and more secure than the usual equity or profit-sharing deals. And that's why I wanted to ask, with all these benefits, it makes me wonder why gross revenue sharing isn’t more common in the tech industry. Is it because people don’t know about it, doubt it would work, or is there another reason?",9,startups,1733669306.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kdd2/gross_revenue_sharing/

At the time I had 3 clients which is big in my space, most startups fail to get the first client. I ended up only getting $400K, 1 check from a VC and 1 from an existing client. The VC is cool, but when they made intros to their friends it fell apart. The biggest feedback was that they didn't feel that the product was ""defence-able"".

On average, large competitors close 2-3 deals a month with a whole sales team and a marketing team. Solo, I did matched by myself. My product is just 10x better and I know how to sell. 

I now have 15 clients and those will be roughly ~ $1M arr once fully implemented. 3 of 12 major competitors are pulling out of the industry because they suck and the business is too tough for them. I need to take their market share in '25. 

My last VC is in for $500k again, term sheet in hand. 3 clients are pitching in $250k combined. The VC however wants me to raise atleast $1M this time however. (We agree on this number, but it's not necessary for me but they think it is). 

So. I hate talking to VC. I have very little tolerance for them taking time away from my family and my clients. How do I go back previous VC that passed and tell them to give me money in as few words as possible? 

Plan B, is to shoot a text out to all the other start-up CEOs I have made friends with over the last decade, and tell them know I need $250K to round out a $1M raise and see who's going to do me a solid a make an intro. 

If I go outside my existing network, do I have to actually make a pitch deck? Or can I get away without that, or half-ass it. Really don't want to spend the hours to make it perfect. I expect to grow to $5M ARR next year and grow faster than any other company in the space. But I won't do that if I waste my time begging folks for money over Zoom. 

Looking for advice or to vent. The VC world borderline doesn't make sense to me. Why make 100 phone calls to raise $250K and when I make 100 phone calls to earn $1M arr?

1h9kczb,Hesitate if I should release my app that has an major defect.,"Here is the background story. I made an app
that help people to learn music staff. The app will show a note on the screen and let users play it, then, it will listen to what users are playing and compute the frequency via a pitch detection algorithm. If the user does play the right note, he will gain a score. The problem is, the algorithm, provided by a small open source library, suffers from octave error. That is, it will give you doubled or half frequency of the pitch that the user's playing, and this situation happens quite often. This make the app produce falsy result. For example, the app shows a A4 note (the frequency is 440hz), and when a user plays a A3 note (the frequency is 220hz), there is a great chance the app thinks the user plays the right note, because the algorithm outputs a false doubled frequency of what the user's playing (A3). To fix this problem requires lots of efforts for me. Either I have to try different open source libraries and evaluate them, or even write my own algorithm. It is really time-consuming.

As what Learn Startup says, I should build a MVP ASAP and find out whether it is what my customers want, so I am considering to release my app now, even it is far from perfect. However I am also fear that releasing an app with such obvious defect will give them a really bad impression about the app. Since I am going to promote the app to music teachers near my place, and I think it is not easy to find one that is willing to try my app, if they dislike it because of the defect, they won't become my users and give me feedback, and I won't know if the app idea is viable. However if I choose to solve to octave error, I might end up wasting time, since I don't know if people need it. Now I really don't know what should I do.",3,startups,1733669273.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kczb/hesitate_if_i_should_release_my_app_that_has_an/
1h94egx,Incentives sound low to join as a founding engineer,"Assuming you get a 4 year vesting schedule and say the company it gets acquired in M&amp;A deal the year or two after you join. Then what's the buyers incentive for keeping the upside on employee equity vs just reducing it to market based compensation?

Example an employee takes a haircut in pay to join a startup, that does well and gets acquired. The employee may have turned their 400k grant to 2M with 2 years left to vest. The acquiring company can determine this is overpaying and reduce their compensation to market pay - let's say 250k stock per year instead of 500K. 

Wouldn't this be less incentive to join a startup vs the alternative of big tech (which will have “uncapped” upside on stock growth + annual refreshers).

1h9347e,I Scaled Two E-Commerce Brands to $1M in Annual Revenue Simultaneously within 2 Years — Here's My Story,"I wanted to share my journey of scaling *two* e-commerce brands to $1M in annual revenue at the same time within two years. It wasn’t easy, and I didn’t follow some “perfect formula.” My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I’m not sharing this as an attempt to “gain karma” or whatever and I’m not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here’s the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I’d “made it.” Spoiler: I hadn’t.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started—broke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I’d ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. “This is it,” I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn’t last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he’d quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in “Print on Demand” platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn’t know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn’t about print on demand—it was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1️⃣ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2️⃣ Make it higher quality.  
3️⃣ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she’s the skeptical type, but she was on board—which made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1️⃣ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it’s not great, it won’t last.  
2️⃣ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3️⃣ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn’t have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here’s the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you’re stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

“The difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it’s literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it’s a choice.”  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It’s up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

1h9j8ie,Insect feed startup in latam (I need a plan),"I have a small business in a Latin American country that produces red runner roaches, mealworms, Zophobas, some black soldier fly larvae, and crickets. All are currently at small-scale levels but with the capacity for growth. I’m a science student and know how to produce them, but I lack expertise in business.

I have some leadership experience from directing a grassroots movement and have many friends and connections, mostly in Latin America and Europe. I currently live in Lisbon and know some people working in venture capital who could help with funding. I also know scientists and professionals from various developing nations from my time at a major international science center, as well as some local politicians and a friend with a farm in Italy.

I feel like I have the conditions to succeed and grow a successful business. However, what’s limiting us is that both my business partner and I are more focused on biology and science. My partner has a BSc in biology, works in wildlife conservation (birds), and raises cattle. I’m a physicist studying evolution and biology, specifically yeastcell biology. Despite our skills, we struggle to concentrate on growing the business.

Right now, we’re making around $65 in small monthly sales, while I pay $130 and my associate $200 out of pocket to cover food for the insects and electricity. Some tasks, like producing more insects, are easier than building something like an oven to dry them.

Our goals include:

• Increasing sales

• Producing our own chicken feed

• Selling compost as a by-product

• Entering the biotech market with products like chitosan

Currently, we have one part-time employee and occasionally hire a second person on a day-to-day basis. I want to hire a friend with extensive entomology experience who worked at a mealworm startup (to which I sold the original colony for $3k), but I can’t afford to hire him full-time. I’m considering paying him a daily rate and having him work a few times a month.

I’d like to buy a solar dryer to start prototyping chicken feed with the BSF but feel unsure about how to move forward. I also own two generic domain names but think we need a better business name. I believe we should create a LinkedIn page, ask friends to share on social media, and build our presence online.

What would you do if you were in my position? I need to balance my time between my PhD and building this business, which I see as a critical part of my future without leaving science entirely.",1,startups,1733665800.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9j8ie/insect_feed_startup_in_latam_i_need_a_plan/

1h9tqi6,"I'll be a hiring a technical founder to manage the development of a proprietary software platform and offering equity in the company as compensation. We are bootstrapped, what is fair?","I run a sales agency, we provide outsourced sales services to other businesses or startups, from lead generation to closing contracts. We are a team of account executives with years of sales experience, most of us were previously in tech sales. We have clients who have hired us as their outsourced sales team so there is revenue already coming into the business. Right now we use third-party VoIP calling services, email services, and CRMs (i.e. Salesforce) on a subscription basis paid for by the clients so they can have access to the entire sales process for transparency. It gets pricey for them and we'd like to instead develop our own proprietary software platform that integrates VoIP, CRM, and sales tools. We obviously cannot create a VoIP service from scratch but we can for everything else, so we'll just be integrating the VoIP through API from our preferred provider. This way we can offer the same services to our clients in a more affordable and reliable way through our proprietary software.

I've been interviewing for a Technical Product Manager position that will eventually develop to the Chief Technology Officer as the company grows. The TPM will lead the development of the software platform, managing the software engineers/devs who will also be compensated in equity or hired on a contract basis, and pretty much leading the vision of the product. I'll  be reviewing final interviews soon and can't decide on the exact details of compensation. 

We own 100% of the company, and other ""employees"" we have outside of us are contracted and compensated with commissions or on a job by job basis, but for this TPM position, it will be different. Whoever I hire will be on this with us for long run. They will have to be as dedicated and excited about this startup as we are. The people I'm interviewing for this position are completely aware that compensation will be mainly in the form of equity as well as sporadic income (for instance, after whatever is leftover of monthly revenue in NOI after debts and commissions are paid, I'll be determining what I can give whether it's a few hundred dollars here in there but not guaranteed every month). I've read of the possibility of providing equity over the months or as milestones are met. The people I'm interviewing have experience in product management, managing software teams, and development. Some have bachelors degrees and some have their masters.

1h9s097,Repost with more info: How do I show tens of ideas for cofounders to choose without getting my ideas stolen?,"Ok, let me repost this because I didn't explain and obviously it went out of control: people went with the usual ""Nobody will steal your ideas"" or the ""idea is nothing without execution”.

Please read, and I hope you can help me.

Hi guys, I have lots of startup ideas and I was wondering which was the best way to share these ideas with possible technical cofounders for them to choose without getting my ideas exposed.

The goal would be to create a startup lab where students and new devs can pick and choose what they want to develop (based on their skills and experience) to learn how to be a startupper and be guided by this lab.

I already received green light from the townhall and our university that will allocate resources to fund this lab and the ideas that will be born from it.

Trust me, if I just wanted to make money it would be much easier to just gather investors and launch the ideas in the list starting from the best to the worst but I'm not doing this for money, at least not only for that.
I genuinely want to do good, I want to create something that will help people create new things and new companies in this new environment where they’re guided, without the risk of more experienced startuppers or software houses stealing the “formative” work.

I could talk literally for hours about this thing but please trust me that I'm not a random guy that just wants to protect his ideas while he talks to devs.

So going back to the “problem”:

Obviously I can't make them sign NDAs for tens, maybe even a hundred, of ideas, and I can't even make them sign a single NDA for all of them because then the contract won't be specific enough.

how would you do? ",0,startups,1733689781.0,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9s097/repost_with_more_info_how_do_i_show_tens_of_ideas/

1h8g50t,I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer,"Had a beer with a buddy of mine the other day—he’s a CRO at a 130-person tech startup. Out of nowhere, he’s like, “Man, I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer.” Not gonna lie, I laughed at first, but then I realized he was dead serious.

So I ask him what’s up, and he just starts venting. He said the hardest part is he feels like he’s supposed to know everything that’s happening in the company, but it’s impossible. Marketing’s doing one thing, sales is doing another, and customer success is in their own little world. And somehow, he’s supposed to connect all the dots and make the revenue grow?

Then he talks about how he has all these big plans—like where they need to be in 6 months, how they should be scaling, all that good stuff. But when it comes to actually putting those plans into action, it’s a mess. Teams don’t align, priorities clash, and stuff just doesn’t get done. He said it feels like no matter how much effort he puts in, something’s always slipping through the cracks.

His exact words: “It’s like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it’s lost deals and missed opportunities. And I’m the only one holding the hammer.”

Honestly, it sounded rough, and it got me wondering—do other CROs feel this way too?

If you’re a CRO (or close to one), what’s the hardest part of your job? Is it the lack of visibility, the struggle to get stuff done, or something else? 

Would love to hear how you deal with it.

1h8pt5k,Cold email works! here's my experience/recommended tools,"I’ve been sending cold email outreach - both for sales of my PR agency and database and to contact journalists/creators on behalf of clients - for around 3 months now.

Stone cold. Zero prior relationship. At massive scale (with AI).

And I was skeptical. But guess what? It works.

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I’ve learnt a ton so far that’s helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don’t rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

Google Workspace  
Apollo  
Coldsire  
Clay  
Instantly

If you’re not cold email outreach with AI, try it! You’d be surprised. Happy to answer more specific questions.",22,startups,1733567604.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h8pt5k/cold_email_works_heres_my_experiencerecommended/

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur discussing some AI product ideas with potential customers and engineers to get feedback. My goal is to have open and collaborative conversations but also ensure everyone is on the same page regarding roles and expectations.

I want to avoid situations where someone thinks they deserve equity or ownership just for providing input. However, I also really value these relationships and don't want them to sour due to misunderstandings. Protecting the work is important but maintaining trust and goodwill is equally critical.

I'm looking for advice from other founders on how to strike the right balance:

* What's the best way to communicate upfront to avoid incorrect expectations?
* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

My aim is to build strong, productive connections while being transparent. I don't want to be overly guarded but also want to mitigate the risk of misunderstandings that could undermine trust.

I’m pricing the online community in two membership tiers. One oriented towards aspiring students thinking about entering a specific field, and existing students across 15 or so US universities at a price point to $49.95 a month. The next tier is professional level, existing community members in early to mid career, looking to connect with professionals in the industry at a price point of $99 a month.

Those who are in this industry are fairly affluent. It is hard to enter the industry, and 99% of those who do go through a masters program. 

Building critical mass early is important. I’ve thought about, but I’ve decided not to offer a free tier. My concern being that the community is flooded with wannabes and ultimately would devalue the community. 

I’m trying to solve for Network effect. I currently do not have any members.

I thought about offering coupon codes to industry insiders they could pass out to others to join that would provide for a period of free access to the site so long as they use a credit card to sign up. I thought about swag after the second month of payment. I’m going to be using an affiliate program , so any new users can refer others for a percentage of the revenue.

We have been good friends for a while and always talked here and there about starting a company. I kind of stopped the ""talking"" and got to work and a week or two later told my friend that hey this is what I have been working on and we agreed to do it together.  I am CEO and he joined as CTO. 

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could!

I've decided I'm gonna tell my parents I'm gonna leave once I've made 1-3K with anything that shows promise and growth over time.

But after a year, nothing works. My patience has declined to the point where I just cant even believe I have to go to school again next week. I need money like fucking tomorrow or this next week. 

I know reality doesn't work that way. But I can't accept it. Can I get honest advice? And how do I reach my goal ASAP? I have a lead gen internship I've started recently but my boss is busy and takes awhile to get things going. 

I'm very emotional about the situation right now. Honest opinion from somone with fresh, logical eyes appreciated.

We want to get customer feedback to inform our first real release to the market, but also want to show traction to investors. MVP will be ready in Q1. The MVP will be very useful, but since our product is a data insights product on publicly available data, we will only have data loaded for one very important state (not 50). (We will be adding more data over the subsequent year.) So whatever we charge for the pilot (if that is the right thing to do) that initial price will not be close to what we eventually charge. My cofounder and I have lots of warm contacts in this sector in which we’ve been working for many years. We’ve used these contacts to give us feedback as we’ve developed the concept, wireframes, and potential market fit. Right now there is no product on the market, which does what our product does.

But here’s the thing: if you split it up, there’s practically one program for every three startups across the entire country. It’s gotten to the point where these initiatives are actively calling startups to headhunt them into their competitions or programs.

This results in startups spending way too much time on flashy competitions and endless programs, and way less time actually running their businesses. There is only so many competitions you can go to before you actually need to start selling to customers.

\- Award me 5% equity in the business (which they are both happy with).

  
They've agreed, but they said they'd want to give me 1% now (which I have upped to 2% because it's just a bit crap, plus the numbers don't add up), and another 1% every 2 months for 6 months to keep us all aligned and motivated.

For the Clients we intent to solve the following problems:

 

• The hassle to find the best candidate for their tech project

• Fear of scams, incomplete/substandard work or getting ghosted by programmers

• Lack of accountability by any freelance site regarding the work of their freelancers

• Regular Management and Coordination of the project between multiple programmers

• Help find suitable projects which suits their skill and experience

• Opportunity to pool their talent on a bigger project and work with people with different skills and experience.

• Build skills working on real world project and also earn money doing so.

• Even as a beginner, start with free projects to earn points and earn enough points to apply for paid projects.

1h91q7g,I’m building an open source AI marketing bot that you can run for FREE (using Ollama),"We all know how valuable Reddit is for shilling your product (just look at this sub). A lot of founders are using it to promote their products.

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I’ve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it’s so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I’ve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I’ve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don’t deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I’m basically running it for free.

Would be curious about if anyone would like to give it a try. I’m building it as an open source tool, but I don’t have any docs yet. So leave a comment for me to know there would be interest and I’ll write docs so you can run it yourself.

Last thing I want to say: I also hate reddit bots and the idea with this tool is not to spam my product. I’m fine tuning it to behave just as I would manually and limiting the number of comments it can post in a day.",0,startups,1733604073.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h91q7g/im_building_an_open_source_ai_marketing_bot_that/

1h892yq,"I launched my MVP, started with the sales. This is what I found out:","Spoiler: I am not able to make a sale, and I don't see it as a bad thing.

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

Its an app in a certain niche so I don't expect it go much high but still the community is growing. 

Here's the issue which I am facing:

My costs are escalating for Bubble and my WUs have passed 1.5 million, and now I am close to getting billed in 1k on monthly basis. On top of that, I want to do something with the app which I can't do technically. 

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

I also received quotations from 5 agencies more and it was around 35-65k USD and on top of that a maintenance and support contract.

1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I’d love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team’s mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team’s energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project’s progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can’t do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important to recognize that. Admitting that you can’t do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it’s more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

1h7swwh,Want to Start a Startup but Stuck – Anyone Else Feeling This?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been dreaming of starting a startup for a while now. I even have some good ideas. But every time I think about starting, I feel stuck. It’s not like I don’t want to do it – I do! But some common problems keep holding me back.

Here’s what I’m dealing with:

* **Where to start?** Sometimes I feel excited about the idea, but when it comes to taking action, it feels boring or overwhelming. Like, I don’t know what to do next.
* **No domain knowledge:** I know tech stuff, but when it comes to business things like marketing, finance, or even running a company, I’m clueless.
* **Money issues:** This is a big one. I know how to build things, but using cloud services and tools costs so much. Every time I think about the charges, it feels like my dream is slipping away.

It’s hard, honestly. I know I’m not lazy, but I feel like I’m stuck in the same place. It’s frustrating because I want to move forward, but I don’t know how to solve these problems.

Are any of you going through the same thing? Or have you been here before and found a way out? I’d love to hear your experiences, advice, or even just some encouragement.

Let’s talk about this and help each other out. Starting a startup feels like a lonely journey, but maybe we can make it a little easier together.",12,startups,1733458535.0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7swwh/want_to_start_a_startup_but_stuck_anyone_else/

1h8glkz,I'm beyond fucked right now,"Hi, I'm 18M. A non technical founder. Since the past 4 months I've working on an online shopping app for my country, as there is a huge gap in the apps space here. I know zero coding and had hired a developer for cheap to develop the app for me, now the app is almost complete but i'm unsure about what i'll do for the maintenance of the app since the guy I was working with says that he'll be too busy to give it any tike. 

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code) 

I can either find someone to do maintenance for the app so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what's the procedure for that, what to keep in mind when hiring or giving access to the app, guidelines etc as I have zero tech knowledge. 

Also, if I hire a developer for maintenance, are there any chances he can like steal the app from me? like remove my access or anything (I'm already sorry if any of this sounds super silly) 

Another option I have is learn the basics myself and try to fix minor bugs myself if I come across any. Could you tell me how long would it take not to learn complete IOS or android development, but just simple maintenance or fixing bugs?

1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this. I talked with a lawyer friend who said that charging fees is pretty normal, but usually for basic work like this it's a much smaller fee. So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for! It feels a little like a tactic to minimize share transfers by former employees - they're taking it just because they have gatekeeping access. 

I had a great experience with the company and I'm super friendly with the people there still - how would you handle this? Is this something you've seen before? Should I just pay it and get it over with? I'm considering reaching out to the general counsel to ask about it or try negotiating.",17,startups,1733441773.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7naik/5k_processing_fee_from_company_for_selling_50k/
1h7k5e0,What I Wish I Did Sooner as a New Founder (Advice for You!),"**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here’s the one thing I’d do differently…**

**Document your journey.**

It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you’re working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here’s why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you’re deep in the grind, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you’ve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I’ve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I’ve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I’m bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I’ve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It’s one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you’re just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you’re doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you’re not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I’ve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

**Don’t wait. Start documenting today, even if it’s just for yourself, you’ll thank yourself later.**",23,startups,1733433519.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7k5e0/what_i_wish_i_did_sooner_as_a_new_founder_advice/

1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace — Do’s and Don’ts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don’t**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash’s founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don’t**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub’s early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **“Aha” Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don’t**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb’s Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace’s reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don’t**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors’ successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don’t**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace’s liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

1h87kt3,Carpooling could disrupt the cab industry.,"Carpooling has the potential to eat into the regularized cab industry, but it’s not yet structured or well-backed by tech.

We humans love connecting with qualified strangers, and carpooling can make that possible. Imagine an executive traveling 15 km to their company. Instead of a ride with an unknown driver, they can carpool with a consultant who’s been in the industry for 20-25 years. 

The value of such an exchange is immeasurable—valuable knowledge shared, strong networks built, and a higher level of security compared to rides with drivers from lower strata or remote areas.

To make this a reality, several things need to be fixed:

1.Quick Availability of Drivers: We need a large number of drivers ready to offer rides, ensuring easy availability.

2.Modernized Mobile App: A highly efficient app is key to seamlessly matching users and drivers.

3.Security: Carpooling with qualified professionals provides higher security compared to unknown drivers.

4.Networking Opportunities: It’s not just about getting from point A to B—it’s about building connections and learning from others during the ride.

Carpooling can be the game-changer in our commuting experience. Let’s take it to the next level!",0,startups,1733508338.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h87kt3/carpooling_could_disrupt_the_cab_industry/

1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I’m a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers—just a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we’d never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here’s what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki’s 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you’re a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it’s vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it’s a significant issue worth solving.

I’d follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I’d revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails—no friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* “This investor will drill into your TAM—make sure it’s airtight.”
* “Avoid using the term ‘AI agent’ with these firms.”

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there’s one thing I wish someone had told me: Don’t raise money in the summer.

1h7aic5,My friend's dad passed away and i am trying to help him.,"Hey Reddit, I’m here hoping to get some guidance from this amazing community.

A close friend of mine recently lost his father, and it’s been devastating for their family. His dad was involved in the alco-bev industry for over 20 years, co-running a company with a few partners. He wasn’t the technical guy, and played a key role in sales and relationships.

After his passing, the other founders have been trying to push my friend out of the company. It’s heartbreaking to see him struggle like this, especially since he now has the huge responsibility of providing for his family.

He’s trying to start his own business in the same field, focusing on importing Vatted Malt Spirit (VMS) from Scotland to India. The thing is, he doesn't know much about how this supply chain works or how to even get started. But he wants to continue in this field since his father accumulated a lot of good will in this industry and he kinda wants to continue his father's legacy.

If anyone has experience in the alco-bev industry, especially with Scottish distilleries or international supply chains, I would really appreciate your advice. My friend has lost so much already, and I just want to do everything I can to help him rebuild.

1h7eo7c,PLEASE consider also other pricing options than Subscriptions,"A full time business/start up coach here! I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It’s been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here’s what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it. 

Bad: You’re critiquing humans, basically, so that’s tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends “I needed online dating help so I paid for it”? No customer retention because they’d get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site’s marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We’d review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out. 

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we’d have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it’s income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn’t make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I’m a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about. 

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect. 

It died because: I didn’t pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn’t know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don’t refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to “build a better mouse trap.”

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools. 

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating. 

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself. 

Bad: User acquisition wasn’t easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn’t pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500. 

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property. 

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don’t assume a company’s internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn’t jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales. 

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted…

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like “Vacord Industries, LLC.” and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just “Vacord” so the emails can be more like “Hey Jack, how’s your xyz at Vacord?” Instead of “Hey Jack, how’s xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?”

Good: People said they’d pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out. 

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:  There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again…

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn’t mean you’ll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It’s easier to market than anything else has been, and it’s got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say “I’m really glad we found your tool” is huge to me. 

Bad: It’s a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it’s growing slowly. I’m starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don’t be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you’re wasting your time and money building something that won’t work in the market.

\----

This isn’t even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing €75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

1h6r9vv,First 100 users for my app in a couple of weeks -Lessons learned so far,"It’s incredibly exciting to hit my first 100 users, and I’m especially proud because I did it without any paid advertising! Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You’re Solving** It’s easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else—fundraising, branding, or scaling—comes second to making sure you’re solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I’ve been building this while working a 9–5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You’re More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you’ll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It’s tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup—branding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you’re not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it’s worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always).

common thread: multiple failed initiatives trying to replace Salesforce with internal tool.

By year 7-8, your founding engineers are gone. No one’s left to push boundaries and build from scratch, so you hire Accenture—and they royally mess it up.

1h6iy9o,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what AI can do for your business—if you start today.",2,startups,1733326668.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/

We are building a tool to create automated product catalogs. Here’s how it will work-

You give us a google sheets link to your products which has the product name, image, description, price etc. 

You can either upload a png of your catalog background or we can import your designed template from canva.

We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.

We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.

Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.

You can download your catalog as a pdf

My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.

While catalog generation and updation is a bottleneck for them, they want it as a service. Where we create excel, create catalog template and generate catalogs for them. Would anyone be interested in this as a diy tool?",2,startups,1733311485.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6dt5g/customers_only_want_managed_service_model_and_not/
1h5oz6l,The Product-Market-Fit confirmation I could only dream about,"Hey there! I'm solo building my SaaS for more than 2 years now, selling for 13 months already. I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster. 

But most importantly, I know have a strong feeling, I'm building something meaningful.

And I wish you all experience the same thing! (unless you already did ;)) 🚀",86,startups,1733237070.0,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5oz6l/the_productmarketfit_confirmation_i_could_only/
1h6cqec,Co-Founders or Investors for SMBs,"
I’m a software engineer based in Australia with startup experience—I ran a small company with 5 employees for 3 years and sold it 10 years ago.

I’ve built an AI app, available only on the App Store, for small businesses like plumbers and electricians. The app helps with:

Invoicing: For example, a plumber can say, “Just fixed John Doe's dishwasher, bill him $200,” and it generates the invoice.

Task management and client tracking

Ad campaigns: Users can ask the AI to set up a Facebook ad to find customers nearby.

Website updates: Easily update pricing or services with voice commands.

The app is live but still in early stages. Some people downloaded it, but no one has registered yet. I also need to add key features like ad campaign tools.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I look for co-founders with skills in online ads (like Google or Facebook Ads) or technical expertise to help grow it?

Or should I focus on finding investors so I can hire a dev team and salespeople?

What’s the smarter choice to grow from here? If co-founders are the answer, how do I find the right ones? If it’s investors, where do I start without a user base?

I’d really appreciate your advice. Thanks!

1h6cn1l,"36 startup ideas found by analyzing podcasts (problem, solution &amp; source episode)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains – this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

Hope this is useful. If anyone would like to ensure I include any particular podcasts or episodes etc. in future posts, very happy to do so.

I'll generally send \~5 ideas per week in a short weekly digest format (you can see the format I'd usually use in here: podcastmarketwatch.beehiiv.com).

I find it mindblowing that the latest models with large context windows make it even possible to analyze full transcripts at such scale. It's a very exciting time we're living through!

Would love some feedback on this stuff, happy to iterate and improve the analysis/ideas... or create a new newsletter on a different topic if anyone would like.

1h6ar6x,Startup Wisdom: Done is Better Than Perfect,"Hey there, startup enthusiasts and fellow entrepreneurs,

I’ve got some advice to share that’s been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? “Done is better than perfect.” Don’t get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100. Then, based on user feedback, you can decide whether to continue investing in improving the product or to pivot.

Another tip is to create a landing page as soon as possible to start engaging with your users. This helps you gather valuable insights and build a community around your product from the get-go.

If you’re in a situation where you don’t have the coding skills or aren’t sure how to create a landing page, check out my profile.

1h5y72m,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?","So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built?

1h5yefu,"Am I thinking correctly about how to develop an ideal client profile for a tool to help websites deal with bot traffic? 
","We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

Am I missing something here?

Am I thinking about it the right way?

What do you guys think?

Stealth AI is your personal expense optimizer. It analyzes your P&amp;L, finds cheaper alternatives for every expense, rates the hassle of switching (A+ to F), and delivers monthly reports with actionable savings. It even scours the web and user reviews to ensure smarter spending decisions. Save money without the headaches—effortlessly.

# Why Now?

* **Economic Pressure**: Businesses are facing tighter margins and growing pressure to cut costs amidst economic uncertainty.
* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.
* **Demand for Efficiency**: Companies are increasingly seeking tools to streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize ROI.

# Competition

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don’t actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.
* **DIY Research**: Most businesses rely on manual comparisons and reviews, which is time-consuming and prone to missed opportunities.

**Edge of Stealth AI**: By combining automated expense analysis, real-time pricing from the web, and community insights (e.g., Reddit), Stealth AI creates a unique value proposition that is both cost-effective and proactive—an unmet need in the market.**""**",0,startups,1733260414.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5ycm3/pl_spending_analyzer/

1h5kgil,What Do Startup Founders Look for in a Banking Partner? Your Insights Needed!,"Hi r/startups!

I’m doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I’ve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners—things like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don’t fit founders’ needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts to help shed light on what really matters to founders when choosing a bank.

If you’re a founder, here are a few quick questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	Who do you currently bank with, and why did you choose them?
	2.	What were the most important factors in choosing your bank (e.g., fast onboarding, reputation, digital tools)?
	3.	What’s one thing you wish your banking partner did better?
	4.	At what stage of growth did having a strong banking relationship become critical for your startup?

Feel free to answer any or all of these! Your insights will go into a write-up I’m working on, and I’m happy to share the findings if you’re interested—just let me know in the comments.

1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *“Why not try making my own dream come true?”*. That’s when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *“You’re a lifesaver!”* That’s when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I’ve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It’s been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I’ve started working on another extension for Claude, which I’m hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

Even though the upvotes were low at \~15, the amount of traffic was pretty decent spiking at 1,100 DAU which was amazing. This makes me think 2 things. Firstly, lots of people  were intrigued enough to try the app and didn't really like it so they didn't upvote.

* plays golf
* reads the financial times
* is a lot on social media
* ...

I've often read and seen people using avatars for their marketing strategy. I undestand that bringing your target audience 'into live' is nice to get a better feeling of what they are like and ultimately how to get in touch with them. But from my understanding most of the characteristics is based on pure speculation and assumptions. Let's take my example with the 30 year old male. I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

I am pretty sure I miss something here, in this entire create an avatar concept.

Do you create an avatar for your marketing strategy? If yes, how does it help you exactly?

I’m currently a med student, and over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in the biomedical device industry. Reading the Biomedical Devices Bill of 2023 really opened my eyes to the potential of this field, and I feel drawn to contributing to it in a meaningful way after completing med school.

That said, I’m at a point where I realize I need guidance. I don’t have mentors or a network in this space, and I’m unsure about where to start or how to approach this field the right way.

If anyone here has experience in the biomedical device industry—or knows someone who does—I’d be so grateful for your advice. Even a brief conversation to understand the landscape, key skills, or first steps to take would mean a lot to me.

1h54n5u,Need Advice: Working for a Startup with No Pay (yet) – Stocks vs. Profit Sharing?,"Hey everyone,

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There’s no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We’re not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here’s the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we’ve put into the company. Right now, he’s unable to pay more money because he’s fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states **""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""** which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I’m a software engineer—I can code fast and efficiently—but this feels like uncharted territory.

I’m currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I’m not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I’m skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes, **stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He’s also offered $500–$1000 a month, but I’d honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here’s my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I am currently a junior in college. I previously, in highschool and at the start of college, ran an Etsy 3D Printing store. I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea. Over the past 3 years, I have had multiple Venture Capital and Incubator internships, working at some pretty large VCs, one having $500M in AUM. I have learned a lot through these internships, specifically on the deal sourcing side and raising side, and I think I would make a really valuable non-technical founder. I also have gained a really strong network of potential capital raisers, and my dad is a lawyer who works with Startups and Venture Capital firms to raise money.

However, I realize that I need to focus on product, acquiring customers, and proving that there is a demand for my e-commerce platform. I am apprehensive about reaching out to my network of VCs for mentoring/advice in case I want to raise with them in the future. My dad has been really supportive but has more experience in the raising aspect, and I am apprehensive about asking him to leverage his network because I am afraid of ruining his reputation (which is very good in his field/area).

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I’m not sure if it’s something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

1h4uu0k,What marketing skills are required for joining early startups? ,"Hi :) 

  
I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting** after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.** Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

1h4qd6o,"A free, searchable directory of Michigan startup tools—useful or not?","Hey founders,

Navigating the startup world can be overwhelming, especially when resources are scattered and hard to find. As a native Detroiter and lifelong Michigander, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to uncover statewide resources like co-working spaces, funding opportunities, accelerators, grants, and events. If you’re not from a specific region or deeply connected, these opportunities can feel hidden.

So, I decided to create a free, searchable directory of Michigan startup resources. It’s designed for entrepreneurs and founders to quickly filter resources by region and tags, making it easy to find exactly what you need—no endless Googling or outdated lists.

This started as a personal project to help me organize everything, but I realized how much value it could provide to others in the startup ecosystem. My goal is to keep it updated and add even more resources over time.

I’d love your feedback:

* Does something like this sound useful for navigating your state’s startup ecosystem?
* Are there similar tools you’ve used or would recommend?

If you’re interested in checking it out or want to share your thoughts - let me know.",1,startups,1733127795.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4qd6o/a_free_searchable_directory_of_michigan_startup/
1h4daw1,Is a patent or IP necessary?,"Hi everyone, I’m building a startup in the healthcare field. I wrote the code during a research year in medical school. I wasn’t enrolled and the school has already said they won’t claim any ownership of the Intellectual Property. 

But a lot of my mentors, who are physicians so aren’t familiar with software startups, advised me to pursue a patent. I’ve heard that software is impossible to patent and usually a copyright is good enough. 

My school, while currently not claiming ownership of the software, says that they are happy to pay the ~$30,000 required to file the patent/IP paperwork as long as I give them full rights to it. 

I don’t want to do that, especially since I have other investors who are happy to cover those costs while only wanting some equity in the company. 

My question is do I really need to file for an IP? If not, what would prevent another company from coming in and doing the same thing I’m trying to do? Other than not having the credibility among the customer base or other external factors like that.

I tried out some of these coupons, and they don't need any user account association.

Instead of wasting these coupons, would it be viable to create a platform, where people can upload their coupons and exchange them for a different one from another user! Kindof like a bidding platform.

Incase they do not like any coupons to exchange for, maybe they can set a nominal price on the coupons, so someone else can pay to buy.

1h488p4,Carta Pricing,"I recently looked into Carta's discounts for early-stage tech startups and thought I'd share what I found, in case it's useful to others. If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don’t meet those criteria, you’ll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven’t already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free—Stripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

Hope this info is helpful!

1h49urb,What’s your top priority for onboarding right after launching a customer-facing service?  ,"Onboarding is the backbone of any customer-facing service.  
No matter how amazing your product is, if users don’t understand it or it takes too long to get started, it’ll quickly become a service no one uses.  

Plus, being too hesitant to show a paywall can hold back revenue, and a trial period that’s too short might stop users from even giving it a chance.  

Here’s what I’ve learned in the first three months of launching my product:  
- Early on, improving onboarding beats developing new features.  
- Letting users start without an account boosted tutorial completion rates by 10%.  
- Don’t fear the paywall—it’s there for a reason.  
- Nobody reads long explanations—let them dive into the experience instead.  
- Open-ended freedom doesn’t work—guide users with a clear first step.  
- Design and fonts? They matter way more than you think.

1h42ybs,"5 Years into my Startup Journey: From DJI to COO of a Startup - Reflecting on Growth, Challenges and Seeking Advice","Hey ​guys,

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

What do you think of those strategies? Any feedback is welcome.",0,startups,1733086978.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4dgoy/got_a_longterm_idea_for_a_startup_but_currently_0/

1h3lod0,How do I get first users to sign up?,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

Their apps are not top level and considered more of mvp or below , while mine is top notch (but still have not lunched).

I posted about the issue before , but now I’m thinking of just reaching out and trying to form a team for 1 startup .

This unfortunately would probably cost me equity as I’m pretty sure i will max at 33.3% if not less .

Have anyone done it ? 

Do you guys think this is a good idea ?

At the end of the day I wanna build a team around the startup so in my thoughts this is not bad .

My ideal route would have been to lunch and beat everyone and then employ the competitors under me without losing equity, but I don’t wanna dream too big and then end up with nothing .

1h2lcnk,Why is Roblox still not profitable despite being the biggest game in the world? ,"This has been puzzling me. Roblox boasts five times the players of Minecraft or Fortnite. On any given day, over 80  million people  log onto the app. That’s an insane scale. Yet, I came across a stat showing Roblox spends about $138 for every $100 in revenue over the last year. How is this possible? Sure, app stores take their cut, but they don’t seem to spend much on marketing, and with fewer than 10,000 employees, labor costs don’t seem overly excessive either. Smaller games like Fortnite and Minecraft are massively profitable.

1h24jxo,how I learned to sell as a founder (without feeling like a sleazy salesperson),"If you think sales are only for “salespeople,” you’re probably leaving money on the table. After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here’s the truth: sales isn’t about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I’ve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50–100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer’s pain points.
4. **Don’t Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return—like a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you’re not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you’re flying blind.

Do you agree or disagree? I’d love to hear your take. LMK!",211,startups,1732824464.0,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h24jxo/how_i_learned_to_sell_as_a_founder_without/

1hcg7nz,Startup Culture,"- Great businesses are all about a great idea.
- Ideas are nothing; it’s all execution. &lt;— we are here.
-  Execution is nothing; it’s resilience.
- Resilience is nothing; it’s timing.
- It’s all just luck.

This pretty much sums up how I feel about startup culture. 

First it was all about the idea, people are obsessed with coming up with the next big thing. Then about execution, and we get bombarded with hustle culture… But then even great execution doesn’t guarantee success. That’s where resilience comes in - sticking with it, pivoting when necessary, and refusing to give up. Except resilience means nothing if you launch a great product at the wrong time.

But then there’s luck. The thing no one wants to admit is that luck.. being in the right place at the right time, connected or rich parents, born in the right location or right time, meeting the right person, or stumbling into the perfect market etc… often plays the biggest role. But books don’t sell the recipe for luck.

1hcpl40,"Ready to run an ad campaign for my vocabulary app, where should I start?","A month ago I launched vocabulary app that lets users explore advanced english words, save ones they want to learn, and then teach themselves the words by taking simple multiple choice quizzes made from example sentences.

The idea is that we learn words by seeing them in context, so there are about 100 example sentences per word allowing the user to get exposure to a bunch of different usages.

It has about 400 downloads, most of which are friends and family + some people from reddit.

I assume I probably won't ever make much money off this app, but I have seen the main Vocabulary app on the App Store have millions of downloads + saw on SensorTower that it generates about $200k per month in revenue. I actually began using this app when I was looking for what my app offers, but honestly was not impressed with the feature offerings.

I'm assuming they probably have pretty high cost on marketing because I see them all over instagram and they come up as the first ad on the app store. Anyways, that makes me think that there is at least decent interest in the ""vocabulary building"" space and a potential to generate some revenue.

This is also my first project and I spent a lot of time on it, so I'm willing to go a few grand in the hole to see if I can get a lot of downloads. If I do, then maybe I could throw some ads on the app or introduce a premium version and paywall some of the features. Idk.

Anyways, would love to get advice on which direction to go.

This is what I'm deciding between:

1. Instagram ads - tooting my own horn here but I think the app has a pretty solid looking UI, so I think the visual nature of instagram lends itself pretty well. Also instagram ads in general seem to be very effective (at least in my personal experience)
2. App store optimization - when I was looking for an app like this I just went to the app store and looked up vocabulary, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Maybe there are other people doing the same thing?
3. Reaching out to vocabulary / dictionary / productivity influencers

I would prefer to only do one of these options and commit 1-2k over the course of a few months.

1hcp20z,How Do I Gather My First Users for My Deals/Discounts Website?,"Hi everyone,

I launched my website about a month ago—a platform similar to HotUKDeals where users can find deals/discounts and upload their own deals to earn a 25% commission on each sale.

After the launch, I started promoting on social media (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and slowly started building followers (Insta: 55, Facebook: 13, TikTok: 23). Through Google Analytics, I can see some traction—about 300 new visitors weekly—but apart from family, nobody has purchased anything via affiliate links.

I’m passionate about the concept and still believe in its potential. However, I’m struggling to build a critical mass of users. I know that to create a successful platform, I need more users to upload deals, which will lead to more sales, more profit, and, ideally, a positive growth loop.

So far, I’ve tried:
	•	Posting regularly on social media.
	•	Following and engaging with people active on similar platforms.

But growth feels slow, and I’m looking for actionable advice to:
	1.	Drive more traffic to the website.
	2.	Encourage people to upload their own deals.
	3.	Build trust and encourage users to make purchases.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear what worked for you. I’m open to any tips, including unconventional ideas or strategies that might not be immediately obvious.

Happy to share more details about my platform, social media strategy, or analytics if that helps!

|fika|Easy to connect and schedule, spoke to an associate who was respectful and intelligent. Did a quick follow up with one of the key partners. The partner meeting looked a bit disengaged and barely asked questions. It seemed he didnt want to be there :) The associate promptly responded in a few days with a respectful reject email citing reasons that seemed genuine. Overall, would still recommend working with them based on the interaction.|8/10|
|Firebolt|The founding partner himself tracked down the startup from a ""VC dark network"". He was persistent. Had 1 call with 2 of the founding partners. They were fully engaged. However, 1 partner who initially reached out seemed to have lost interest half way and started asking annoying questions. Never heard back from them after that 1 call. Total ghosting :)|5/10|
|NextView Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. However, they rescheduled it on the day off the call. When we actually met, the partner disclaimed that they know very little about my space. They asked high level questions. Mid-way through their child walked into the meeting :) I honestly didn't mind it. Kids will be kids! But then the kid got on the nerves of the partner who lashed out their kid right in front of me. Ouch :( The partner was totally distracted from that point on. After a few days they got back promptly citing a legitimate sounding reason.|6/10|
|Ridge Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. The partner was respectful and genuinely interested in learning about the startup. At the same time earnestly raised concerns about my market and it's ability to create winners. They followed up with an investment committe meeting. The meeting invite was awesome. It had the names of the attendees and their backgrounds in good detail so it saved me a ton of time researching each one of them. During the call, all of them were leaning in and genuinely interested in learning about the opportunity. They also challenged certain aspects but did it respectfully. Finally, they promptly followed up but without giving a reason. I requested to give some feedback and the partner setup a call! However, they did a no show on the call :)|9/10|
|SignalFire|They reached out by finding about the startup from the ""VC dark network"". The main contact was very excited after the first call. He followed up with a few questions and then setup a quick follow up with a couple other people. On the second call, the founding partner was suave and respectful. Although he didn't lean in much. A principal was hyper enthusiastic trying to impress his partners by asking awkwardly challenging questions. The main contact responded promptly with a reject and citing specific reasosn which was much appreciated.|9/10|
|Vertex|Call was scheduled promptly through a strong connection. Two partners showed up and both were great to interact with. They were genuinely trying to understand the business and evaluate the opportunity. Through the call it started to emerge that they didn't see it. But despite that they were respectful, cited their initial concerns. They did say that they will get back shortly with a more thoughtful reason. But they ghosted :) At least they were nice on the call!|7/10|
|Weekend Fund|Call was scheduled promptly. The partner was not familiar with the space but leaned in with decent questions. They said they would follow up. There was silence for several days but eventually got back. They claim to be pre-seed but they said they need more traction.|7/10|
|Zero Prime|The junior partner found the deal through the ""VC dark network"". Persisted and eventually we met. He was very enthusiastic and said will quickly follow up with a partner meeting. But then ghosted. No news ever again!|4/10|
|A16Z|Connected to a partner who was from my alma mater. First call was scheduled promptly. They were genuinely interested and asked good questions. They liked the space and the problem being addressed. They promised to follow up shortly. They did follow up citing genuine reasons.|8/10|
|HustleFund|Very frustrating and unclear process. They make you fill out a TypeForm form. Its quite an unwieldy way to fill out long pieces of text. It doesn't save your responses etc. Once I submitted they just sent a reject email in less than 24 hours :D What a fricking waste of time. They logged into the deck but didn't look beyond the title slide. So they didn't really evaluate it. Stay away!|2/10|
|Canaan|Scheduled promptly. Through the meeting didn't really engage and show genuine interest in learning about the statup. They were upfront that they do only companies with traction. So they should have not really even taken the meeting. They said they would get back shortly. But ghosted!!|4/10|
|Unusual Ventures|They were definitely on the bottom of my list. After submitting an online form they very eagerly and promptly setup a meeting based on the teams profiles. During the meeting, they were waiting for one of their main partners who joined late. That partner came totally unprepared and started off with a very condescending tone right of the bat. They were combative right from the beginning and just wanted to play Shark Tank - it seemed like it was entertainment for this partner. I told him that I have already heard that you didn't like this deal and hinted that we don't need to talk any further. Through the back channel later heard that that partner is quite toxic. Stay away!|1/10|
|Boldstart Ventures|Approached them through a warm contact. They didn't take a meeting citing their genuine position on my market - they don't invest in my market. Respect to them for saving everyone's time.|7/10|
|Costanoa|Another one towards the bottom of my list. It was easy to get in touch through a warm intro and the call was scheduled promptly. Two people joined - one was a partner, it wasn't clear what the other person was. This other person was a new member on the firm. They started of asking questions to stump you. There was barely any indication of a genuine effort in understanding the business. The body language was very poor. It felt condescending. They said they would get back in 2 to 4 weeks, but they never got back.|3/10|

|Array VC|This one was also on the bottom of my list. The partner does not reply to emails promptly. And when they replied they were short half sentence emails - lack of genuine interest/professionalism. They claim they are focused on data &amp; analytics. So I thought they would be genuinely interested. But they didn't go beyond email interactions.|2/10|
|Wing Venture Capital|They comfortably found the link to my deck through the ""VC dark network"", went through it without permission, probably didn't like the deal and never even contacted me. It felt very disrespectful that they just went to the deck though they were not explicitly given access to it. Shady!!|2/10|
|Wave Capital|Conneced through a friend, very nice guy. Thoughtful and attentive. Not a market fit as they are into marketplaces. But still offered to connect to their network.|8/10|
|Afore Capital|In the bottom half of my list. I connected with a partner through a warm connection. But without even responding to me an associate took over. The associate set up a 20 minute meeting!! And for that they showed up 10 minutes late. So after a 15 min evaluation from a recent grad my startup got rejected. Wow! I am sure they spoilt with good deals.|3/10|
|GGV (Notable)|They took the meeting promptly. However, there was not much interest in engaging when they were on the call. They said they would get back, but they never did. Why do their waste their own time (and mine!)|4/10|

|Lerer Hippeau|Connected through a friend and was promptly scheduled for a meeting with an associate. The associate was very nice and engaged with inquisitive questions. He set up a follow on with one of the main partners. The main partner, however, was not very engaged he had made up his mind a few minutes into the call that this is not a deal he likes, which is fine. He said he'll get back with some feedback. Couple of days later they got back with some feedback.|8/10|
|Emergent VC|Got connected to them through a friend. The partner requested for updates over email. Sent them all the updates but the partner never even replied to the email. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Ovo Ventures|Easy to schedule with them, met them through a warm connection. The partner met and asked great questions and it was a good lively discussion. They did make it clear what the concerns were during the meeting. And then very promptly followed back, citing their reasons honestly. Very respecttful &amp; professional!|9/10|
|Kearney Jackson|Met them through a warm connection and the meeting was set up pretty quickly. Both the partners showed up and engaged very actively asked great questions. It felt like I learned something. They got back promptly, giving genuine reasons. Very professional great performance would work with them .|9/10|
|Nexus|Met them through a warm connection and a meeting was set up promptly. The partner was very curious and fully engaged. The meeting was in person. After going through the business, he was upfront that he didn't see a good market opportunity. But was classy in the way he said that. He did say he would follow up, but he never did.|7/10|
|Lightspeed Venture Partners|This was again through a warm connection and the meeting was set up promptly. The partner was engaged, although it wasn't clear how much he really understood. He did ask for some time to evaluate the business. He got back after a few days in a professional manner. No real complaints but wasn't impressive.|7/10|
|Montavista|I sent an email directly to the main partner who is from the same alma matter as me. They responded quickly and scheduled  time for an in person meeting along with the partnership. Everybody showed up on time. They had six people on the call. Three in the room with me and three on a Zoom call. Couple of them has great genuine questions and wanted to understand the opportunity. However, one person was very annoying, trying to put me down several times. It seemed they were trying to justify their value to the partnership by saying things like ""I can connect you with this big guy or that big guy"". The main partner, however, was awesome. He got back promptly citing his reasons for rejection.|7/10|
|Altos Ventures|Met the partner through a warm referral. They suggested an in person meeting. However, they don't have any parking around there which made it stressful. Also, it was far away from where I live so it was too much time commitment. And what made it more annoying was that within the first two minutes we established that they don't do preseed and seed stage investments. I wish they had just done a zoom call before an in-person. To their credit the partner was very nice and we had a good debate around the pros and cons of my startup strategy.|6/10|
|ENIAC VC|Got an intro into the firm from a warm referral. However, the email responses were very slow and when they did respond, the scheduler did not set up a meeting. I had to send a reminder to get the meeting scheduled. The partner who I met with did not really lean in. They said they would get back with next steps, but never did. Ghosted!|4/10|
|Foundation Capital|Got connected to them through a warm referral. In fact, foundation wanted to meet with me. However, when we connected they scheduled a meeting three weeks out! And on the day of the meeting, they rescheduled it. And then on the day of the meeting, the partner said that they would be taking the call on voice while driving. The audio was terrible. During the meeting, the partner was condescending. The saving grace was that the partner was smart and direct which I totally appreciate. But they were disrespectful which I totally don't appreciate.|4/10|
|Peak XV|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled two weeks out! When we met, one partner was still driving to work and the other partner was running behind. They did engage actively and showed genuine interest in the problem space. They said they would evaluate the market and get back for next steps. But I never heard back. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Village Global|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled promptly. I had to reschedule the first meeting because of an emergency. But the partner was very respectful and promptly accepted the reschedule. When we met, we established that they are from my industry. That really made the conversation engaging and meaningful. They got the idea! They followed back with very good questions. They also set clear expectations about the timeline for a decision.|8/10|
|Swift Ventures|They reached out to me by finding about me through the ""VC dark network"". The meeting was set up promptly, and one of the main partners attended. The discussion was decent. The partner was humble. But knew very little about my space. I thought it was a no-go I did not bother to follow up. But they followed up a few days later asking for my deck to have a clear closure. I sent the deck and a few hours later they got back stating their reasons for not going through.

1hci1oy,Freelance/Task Platform MVP Without an Escrow System?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice from entrepreneurs, developers, and experts who’ve worked on building platforms or MVPs.

I’m based in Ethiopia, where platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit have a huge untapped market but also face unique barriers. My goal is to create a platform tailored to my country, solving challenges like:

Payment Systems: Most Ethiopians don’t have access to international payment platforms like PayPal.

Language Barrier: Many don’t speak fluent English to navigate these global platforms.

Task Complexity: Many tasks on these platforms require high-level skills. I want to focus on simple, delegatable tasks, both digital and physical.


My Plan

I’m starting small with an MVP to validate the idea. Initially, I planned to use a Telegram bot interlinked with channels to mimic the platform experience. The idea was:

Users could find and post tasks for free (no commissions).

The bot would handle task assignments and communication.

Tasks would be split into digital (simple remote tasks like trimming videos or translating text) and physical (local jobs like delivering items or assembling furniture).


However, I hit a major roadblock:
I need an escrow system to build trust between users. But to integrate with Ethiopia’s banking system, I’d need:

A registered business

A trade license

A physical office, etc.


This requires upfront money (~$2000), which I don’t have.

My Question

How can I build an MVP that attracts users without an escrow system?

Are there ways to create trust and security without formal escrow?

Can I simplify the platform further to avoid needing banking integration?

Should I pivot to a different MVP idea that requires fewer resources?


I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. If anyone has tackled similar challenges, your advice would be invaluable.

1hbxxpd,How I run customer interviews (and why they're better than analytics for 0-1),"## Why talk to customers?

Look, I've built products at companies of all sizes - tiny startups, growing scale-ups, and 500-person enterprises. The one thing that's always worked? Actually talking to customers. Especially when you're starting from scratch.

Don't get me wrong - tools like Amplitude are great at showing you what people do in your app. But they miss everything that happens outside it. Some of the best insights I've found came from discovering that people were using weird Excel templates or Word docs as workarounds. You'd never catch that in your analytics.

## Getting good at interviews isn't hard

A lot of people get nervous about customer interviews. I get it - talking to strangers can be awkward. But honestly? It comes down to a few simple techniques that anyone can learn. Here's what works for me when I'm trying to understand customer problems.

## The techniques that actually work

### Ask questions that let people ramble

The best insights come when you let people tell their stories. Instead of asking ""Do you use Excel for this?"" (which just gets you a yes/no), ask ""How do you handle this today?"" Then shut up and listen.

### Repeat stuff back to them

This one's surprisingly powerful. When someone spends five minutes explaining their process, just summarize it back: ""So what you're saying is...?""

Two things happen:
1. If you misunderstood something (which happens all the time), they'll correct you
2. They often remember important details they forgot to mention

### Go down rabbit holes

Some of the best stuff comes from completely random tangents. When someone mentions something interesting, keep pulling that thread. Keep asking why. I've had calls where we went totally off-topic and found way bigger problems than what we originally wanted to talk about.

## How to run the actual call

### First five minutes

I always start the same way:

""Hey, thanks for jumping on. We've got 30 minutes - that still work for you? Cool. I wanted to talk about [topic]. You might have other stuff you want to ask about, but let's save that for the end if we have time. That sound okay?""

Simple, but it:
- Makes sure they're not running off to another meeting in 10 minutes
- Keeps things focused
- Lets them know they'll get to ask their questions too

### Diving into the conversation

Here's the thing about good interviews - they should feel like natural conversations, not interrogations. Start as wide as possible. I usually kick off with something super open-ended like ""Tell me about how you handle [whatever process] today.""

Then just listen. Like, really listen. When they mention something interesting, that's your cue to dig deeper. Say they mention ""Yeah, it's frustrating because I have to copy stuff between systems."" Don't just note that down and move on. That's gold! Follow up with ""Tell me more about that. What are you copying? Where from? Where to?""

The best stuff often comes from these diving-deeper moments. Maybe you'll discover they spend two hours every Friday copying data from their ticketing system into Excel because the reporting sucks. That's the kind of insight you can actually do something with.

Sometimes the conversation will hit a natural lull. That's when you pull from your question bank. But don't rush to fill every silence. Some of the best insights come right after those slightly awkward pauses when people remember ""Oh yeah, and there's this other thing that drives me crazy...""

### Questions I keep handy

Instead of a strict script, I keep a list of reliable questions I can throw in when needed:

- ""How do you deal with this right now?""
- ""On a scale of 1-10, how annoying is this problem?""
- ""What's an even bigger pain in your day?""
- ""Tell me about the last time this came up""
- ""Do you use any other tools for this? Excel? Word?""
- ""If you could wave a magic wand, how would this work?""

Don't treat these like a checklist. They're just there for when the conversation hits a wall or you need to dig deeper into something interesting.

### How to keep it flowing

1. Start really broad. Let them talk about their day, their problems, whatever's on their mind.

2. When they mention something painful, dig into it.

3. Sometimes asking about the same thing different ways helps. People might not realize they're using a workaround until you specifically mention spreadsheets or sticky notes.

4. Save the ""magic wand"" question for last. By then they've thought through all their problems and can better imagine solutions.

## Stuff that kills good interviews

1. **Asking leading questions**: Don't say ""Wouldn't it be better if..."" Just ask ""How would you improve this?""

2. **Trying to sell**: You're there to learn, not pitch. Save the product talk.

3. **Sticking too hard to your questions**: If they start talking about something interesting, follow that instead.

4. **Not recording**: Always ask if you can record. You'll miss stuff in your notes, and sometimes you need to hear exactly how they said something.

## Why this matters

Here's the thing: Analytics can tell you what users do, but only interviews tell you why. The best products I've worked on started with stuff I never would have found in analytics. They came from actual conversations where I shut up and let people tell me about their weird workarounds and daily frustrations.

Sure, it takes time. Yes, it can be awkward. But it works better than anything else I've tried.",39,startups,1733935901.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbxxpd/how_i_run_customer_interviews_and_why_theyre/

1hcfpwh,Turning a Dream into Reality: Seeking Support to Empower Thousands in Ethiopia,"Hi everyone,

I’m a dreamer from Ethiopia, a country where opportunities are hard to come by, but dreams still thrive. I’m working on building something that could change lives—not just mine, but countless others in my community. It’s a platform that seamlessly connects task creators with task doers. Imagine waking up stressed about money, without a job, or being a student needing quick income. My platform would let anyone with a laptop or phone find simple, quick tasks they can complete remotely—whether it’s a 2-hour gig or a one-day job. No hassle, no stress, just a way to make legitimate money right from your bed.

This isn’t just a website to me; it’s my passion and my purpose. I want to create a credible, seamless, and addictive platform that gives people a chance to thrive. For many here, $2,000 might not seem like much, but in Ethiopia, it’s a fortune. It’s the one barrier stopping me from making this vision a reality.

Sadly, platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter don’t work in my region, and finding funding locally is almost impossible. So, I’m reaching out directly to anyone out there who believes in the power of ideas and the impact one person can make. I know this idea has the potential to transform lives, to take people from feeling stuck to feeling empowered.

If you’ve ever had a dream you believed in with your whole heart but just didn’t have the resources to bring it to life, you know how I feel. I need $2,000 to get started, and I promise this isn’t just about me. It’s about building a system that helps people in my country find dignity, opportunity, and hope in the simplest way.

If you can support me or even share this message, you’re not just helping me; you’re becoming part of a journey to create something bigger than both of us. One person’s trash is another person’s gold, and this dream is my gold.

Thank you for reading and for believing in someone you’ve never met. Sometimes, all it takes is one act of kindness to change a life—and maybe many lives.",0,startups,1733987830.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcfpwh/turning_a_dream_into_reality_seeking_support_to/

1hca7ev,Employee #1 - how to structure/write my own ESOP offer?,"Hey all, I'm about to join a *very* early-stage startup as employee #1.

The co-founders and I have already agreed in principle that I will be getting a fixed $amt translatable into shares (for the sake of discussion, let's say $500K). The number of shares will be pegged at the valuation of the next funding round, which is set to occur fairly soon. Again, for the sake of discussion, let's say that the post-money valuation cap of the upcoming round is $5M. My share would translate to 10%. But it could be $10M and my share would be 5%, etc.  This would be vested monthly over 4yrs with a 1yr cliff.

When seeking innovative countries to invest in startups, how does a country like Switzerland outpace, for example, Brazil in innovation? Switzerland’s culture feels notably risk-averse compared to Brazil, which is loaded with creativity and faces numerous basic challenges to address. However, one country produces far more innovations than the other, leading me to conclude that innovation might rely more heavily on government policies and systems than on the will or culture of the people.

1hc01id,Product and Message Differentiation is everything. Here's how I find both ,"**Introduction:** 

Great messaging is essential. Your message is the first thing anyone hears, reads, or sees about your business. It’s your elevator pitch, business card, tagline, and more all rolled into one.

Differentiated messaging — the only kind that really matters — is even more important. It not only conveys who you are, but who your target customers are and how you help them in a way your competitors can’t.

If done well, differentiated messaging helps every part of your organization level up:

* **Marketing** understands *who* you want to reach and *how* your company alone can help them. The team writes better copy, creates more effective campaigns, and builds an inbound machine filled with great prospects.
* **Sales** understands marketing’s *who* and *how*, but is also armed with a cheat code that helps them thrive in any competitive conversation they encounter.
* **Product** gets a clearer understanding of your advantage in the eyes of your customers (as opposed to their minds) and doubles down on what buyers care about most and can make smart investment and roadmap decisions.

Without a solid differentiated foundation, you and your teams suffer from:

* **Confusion**: What exactly does your company offer that’s special and why do customers care?
* **Low-confidence:** How do we talk about our product and business? Are these campaigns and talk tracks likely to work? What do we build? Who do we pursue?
* **Second-guessing and bad suggestions:** Without doing the hard work of figuring out how you're unique and valuable (i.e. differentiated), every mediocre idea gets considered, every good idea is prone to second-guessing. You waste time, energy, and enthusiasm.

You need to do the work to set a foundation and execute.

The good news: None of the above is that difficult to overcome. With a little knowledge of your competitors, product, and customers, you can create great differentiated messaging. 

All it takes is the right framework and some time.

**A few useful definitions:** 

* **Differentiator:**A characteristic of your firm that separates you from key competitors and gives you a perceived advantage in the eyes of your target customers
   * Key Elements: 
      * Entire firm, not just the product
      * Key competitors, not every competitor
      * Customer focus  
* **Messaging:**The key concepts you want a prospect to know about your company. What do you provide? How do you provide it? What value do customers receive? Messaging is the foundation that supports effective marketing, copywriting, campaigns, sales conversations, and more.  
* **Differentiated Messaging:**This is the unique message and story that only you can tell because of the product and company you’ve built and customers you serve. It tells prospects how you’re uniquely valuable to them and how you alone can help achieve a particular outcome. Differentiated messaging should be your marketing team’s holy grail and first priority before writing a website, one-pager, case study, or any other piece of collateral.

**Step 1: Get Smart**

You’re going to have a very hard time telling a compelling story about your business if you don’t understand your product, customers, and competitors, which are the Core Components of Differentiated Messaging.Founders *sometimes* know their product, customers, and competitors well enough to proceed straight to Step 2, but there are plenty of founders who have understandably confused themselves about who they serve well and why. They’re too in the weeds to be effective marketers. 

Other leaders — CMOs, sales and product leaders, and product marketers — will need to partner across teams to make sure they’ve got the requisite knowledge to have a fruitful discussion.The idea is to know each of the Core Components as a team. A single individual doesn’t need all of this knowledge, but across a team, you need to know product, customers, and competitors. 

In general you should know (or get to know) your:

* Customers: 
   * Firmographics: What types of businesses have you sold to in the past? Consider industry, team size and composition, revenue, geography, tech stack, and customer base. This will help you develop a hypothesis about which potential segments you serve best.
   * Buyers: Who within a firm do you sell to most often? What persona? Who else is in the buyer map?
   * Problems: What problems are the companies you serve facing? What are they trying to accomplish?
   * Why you: The most difficult question to answer accurately is why customers chose you. Your sales conversations should give you an idea about why a customer chose you, but you may need to circle back and ask again. A decent win-loss program really helps here.

* Product: 
   * Features: You may have a technical product with a long list of features. It’s possible that 1-2 of these are a key differentiator.
   * Non-Product Attributes: While we tend to focus on features in technology, it’s likely that your customers value some other aspect of your firm. The sales experience, delivery channel, customer service, industry expertise, and more are all possible differentiation factors. So while the product gets the most attention, be sure to think beyond the software.  
* Competitors: 
   * It’s easy to go too deep on your competitors. You can easily consider too many competitors and think too much about their features, customers, investors, marketing and more. Instead, focus on the three competitors you see most often in deals, and focus on their marketing. Limit your research here competitors’ websites and five most recent blog posts and press releases. You’ll need to consume this marketing with a critical eye. Look for what they’re saying and *what they’re not saying*.

**Step 2: Structured Workshop With Your Team**

This is the crux.

Of the three steps, this workshop is the one that has the biggest potential impact. If done well you’ll surface useful disagreements, compelling insights, unique perspectives, and come to consensus on what matters most. It uncovers facts, drives alignment, and helps win buy-in, all of which are keys to a successful messaging project.

I use a framework called MUD, which I learned from a very smart colleague. MUD is an acronym for:

* Meaningful: Can we charge money for this attribute?
* Unique: Do we alone offer it? Can our target customers get the same thing elsewhere?
* Defensible: Can we prove what we claim with data or testimonials?

Here’s the workshop process:

1. **Discuss potential differentiators as a group**This isn’t quite a brainstorm, but it is a broad discussion about your business and customers. You want to encourage people to consider the business broadly and think beyond mere product features — remember the elements of a differentiator in the definition above.You’ll notice the same ideas surfacing again and again from slightly different angles, with slightly different emphases. That’s great! Let the ideas and opinions flow during this portion of the discussion. That said, it’s helpful if you can combine similar ideas to points that have already been made, as it makes subsequent steps easier. An experienced facilitator can really help here.Depending on your product and market, you should generate a list of 10-30 potential differentiators.  
2. **Evaluate based on MUD**With a list of 20-30 potential differentiators in hand, you then evaluate them based on the MUD framework.Go down your list and ask yourselves if each is Meaningful (will someone pay for this attribute), Unique (you alone offer it), and Defensible (can you prove it). Be very honest. The temptation to fudge is strong, especially when you’re discussing Uniqueness, but being soft here will hurt in the long run. Again, an experienced facilitator can help you navigate tough questions and commit to ideas with promise.The MUD process should hone your imprecise list of 20-30 potential differentiators down to 3-5 well-articulated, high-quality attributes that you can share confidently with your team, prospects, and customers.

**Step 3: Refine results to craft a compelling story**

A workshop alone won’t lead to clear and compelling differentiators. You’ll need a team of articulate colleagues to make your differentiators shine and to highlight the value that each delivers. Spend time with a colleague or two to refine what you created in the workshop and highlight the value each delivers for your target customers.You should seek to use each of your differentiators as a pillar that supports a compelling story about your customer, product, and market. And that story should lead customers directly to one solution … yours.

1hbsxn7,Are you pivoting after a negative pitch?,"Hi all,

so my co founder and me (I am the IT guy) just had our first real pitch to a potential pilot customer. We are working on a platform where users are able to buy services. The niche is not very digital yet. 
So we presented our idea and he said that it will not work because they will always use the payment and redemption options in their existing POS provider. They are also working on some local apps to have it more digital and don't need an overall platform, because we will not be able to onboard all other businesses. 
So we are asking ourselves now if we need to pivot on some main features or not. Our app will be much better for the enduser, but if we don't have businesses on our platform it will not help. An integration to the POS systems would be great, but to expensive at the beginning. We wanted to handle the payments here and redeem the products via QR Codes in the beginning. I still think we have a great solution, but he said we should change the area for our business.

So are you pivoting some features after every feedback or do you evaluate the feedback and then continue working on the general product?

1hbrl60,3 Key Elements of a High-Converting Web App MVP 🚀,"As someone who builds MVPs as a part of my daily job, I’ve learned a lot about what works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to creating impactful web applications. Here are three things I always keep in mind:

1️⃣ **Simplicity is Key:** Your MVP isn’t meant to be feature-packed. Focus on the **core problem** you’re solving and implement just enough functionality to validate your idea. Adding too many features early can overwhelm users and delay launch.

2️⃣ **User Feedback Drives Growth:** The first version isn’t perfect—and it shouldn’t be. Launch early, then use **real feedback from users** to guide the next steps. Tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics can help you understand user behavior.

3️⃣ **Landing Pages Matter:** Your app is only half the battle. A clear, well-designed landing page with strong CTAs can significantly improve conversions. Highlight the benefits over features, and keep the design clean to avoid cognitive overload. A Good looking landing page &amp; a high conversion landing page are two diff things.

If you’re a founder working on an idea or struggling with getting your MVP to market, feel free to share your challenges in the comments. I’d be happy to brainstorm ideas or offer advice. Let’s help each other build something great!

1hbz0xm,Worth Building this SAAS?,"I'm working on a SAAS which takes your content and localizes it, this includes translation with lipsyncing, using your own voice for dubbing etc.. as well as channel creation and automatic uploading. So you can link your youtube channel, select ""Spanish"" and the channel will be created and automatically go through the localization and uploading process every time you upload to your main channel, hence expanding your viewership/brand/revenue.

This will be available for Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter etc..

The main pushback against this is product is that Youtube is starting to add an ""Audio Track"" setting that enables automatic dubbing for your channel. The problem with relying solely on this Youtube feature for localization is that

1. It's being rolled out slowly and only available for a small amount of creators.
2. Even when dubbing is added it's unnatural because of the unsynced lips
3. Dubbing takes away the personal connection you create with your actual voice/brand recognition and uses a generic sound that is probably assigned to every other channel.
4. This may be incorrect but I've read that mixing your channel demographics from different countries can lower the ad rates for US based channels which have the highest rate. So if users start watching dubbed spanish and your main user base starts to shift from the US to say Brazil, then the revenue you generate will start decreasing opposed to keeping a purely US based rate.
5. While other platforms may start to push out dubbing sometime soon, right now only Youtube has just started to do it and trying to implement the other features such as using your own voice for dubbing at the scale Youtube has to deal with will be nearly impossible for a long time.

1hbkqyi,Llama is better? My client insists on Claude for building an AI Agent,"I’m working on a project where I need to build an AI agent for a client. As someone who has evaluated different models, I genuinely believe LLaMA (especially its recent iterations) is better for the job. Here’s why:
	1.	Customization: LLaMA is open-weight, which means I have far greater flexibility to fine-tune and tailor it for the specific use case. This level of control is perfect for creating a specialized agent.
	2.	Cost-Efficiency: Hosting LLaMA locally or on dedicated infrastructure can save significantly in the long term compared to relying on Claude’s API pricing structure.
	3.	Performance: Depending on the task, LLaMA has shown better accuracy and reasoning capabilities in many benchmarks. It also has a more robust architecture for handling nuanced instructions when properly fine-tuned.
	4.	Privacy: Since LLaMA can run on custom infrastructure, I can ensure data security and privacy, which is a big concern for many businesses these days.

However, my client is adamant about using Claude. I get it—it’s user-friendly, has a solid API, and works great out of the box for many general-purpose applications. But I feel like Claude’s closed ecosystem and less customizable nature might limit the long-term potential of the AI agent we’re building.

Am I wrong for pushing back on this? Has anyone else faced a similar situation where the client insists on a tool that you know isn’t the best fit? Would love to hear your thoughts on navigating this!

I have a tech background and have blasted through building an MVP/prototype that shows off my idea concept, it took about 5 weeks. I'm trying to build interest and 75% of the time people respond positively (if they reply),  A handful of people have reached out asking to try it free of charge and but I haven't received any feedback yet. I have been reaching out to people via LinkedIn private messaging and reddit forums.

My idea is healthcare-related and I get the impression that many people in the industry are just overworked and don't have time nor motivation to try out my solution. They need an incentive, I am basically saying ""*hey, I made a thing, please can you try it for me AND let me know what you think for free???*"", it is a shock to me that people are even saying yes to this.

I don't know how to give that incentive to them without scaling the product, but then it would be foolish to scale a product that hasn't been validated, no?

- AI does the heavy lifting: use it to design unlimited amounts of websites in seconds, or choose from 200+ professionally designed templates. 
- Not confident with tech? No worries, you can schedule a free 1-on-1 website setup call where we’ll design the website for you. (Basically, you’re getting a free web designer- no stress or hidden fees)
- Plus, our websites are easy to manage, you can do any updates yourself, anytime, without paying a penny more. And we have an online course with answers to all topics. 

This AI website builder has been developed all year and we’re now wanting more people to test it out for themselves, and to also gauge the interest from people - although we did reach 6K followers from pre launch ads! (Humble brag)

Right now, we’re working with service based businesses only, as we don’t want to burden ourselves with e-commerce functionality at the start, although we do have this as an option, it just requires some extra coding.

If you’re wondering how we’re offering this service for free, our platform offers website hosting and we also have a marketing agency so developing these connections will only help us work with the next big upcoming businesses. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
- Does this sound like something you or a small business owner you know would use?
- What features would make a platform like this a no brainer for you?
- Any feedback on the concept or launch strategy?

If you’re curious to see how it works, just drop me a message - happy to arrange a call or I can share the website if you want to test it out for yourself.

Looking forward to your thoughts and advice! I’m here to learn from the community and improve where I can. ",0,startups,1733928027.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbux45/ive_built_an_ai_website_builder_and_its_free_to/
1hbch7r,Do we need a co-founder or an employee?,"Hi,

We're a B2C startup that just surpassed $12k MRR, bootstrapped, and we're also doing a spinoff - a B2B product that grew from a personal pain point we experienced while growing our B2C business through SEO. We have some early traction with B2B, but B2C remains our primary source of revenue.

We've also raised a very small FFF round to accelerate our growth. We're a very small team at the moment, just two brothers as co-founders. I'm the CEO/CTO, technical, write code and sell, with lots of experience from working at YC and big tech. My brother is non-technical, a CPO/CMO blend, responsible for marketing, product, operations, and customer support. We also have two hired people: a content marketer and a software engineer.

Our blind spots are structure, project management, and strategy. We all hate routine and project management. I feel a need for someone to step into a role to help us ""get organized.""

A friend of mine organically approached us and made himself useful on several fronts. He helped us think through our goals and financial projections. He's really good with data, holds a PhD in computer science, but he's more of a Data Science person. We also get along very well (I've known him for 10 years now but never worked on any substantial project together). He's also remote. I'm in SF, my brother's in Warsaw, and he's in Amsterdam.

Now we want to make a decision about whether to make him an offer as a co-founder. Help me think this through. Here are the questions I've asked myself so far:

1. Would this person increase the probability of success for this company? Yes, I think he will. But maybe if I looked more intentionally, I'd find someone who would accelerate us even faster. I'm not sure.
2. Can I hire this person? No, I can't. His salary is north of $300k yearly, and we wouldn't be able to afford that.
3. Are his skills complementary to ours? Yes, he has much better presentation skills than anyone in our group. He also has a PhD, which looks good on paper and will attract better talent.
4. Do we get along? Yes, I feel comfortable in his presence and would love to hang out together.

His role would be something like chief of staff, plus he could help with engineering.

Now, I know this is a lot of words, but what questions should I ask myself before making him a co-founder or deciding otherwise?",4,startups,1733865216.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbch7r/do_we_need_a_cofounder_or_an_employee/
1hb7bu8,Should I Quit My Job to Pursue My Startup Idea?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads and could really use some advice. I work as an staff applied research scientist in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and during my job, I’ve identified a significant problem in the process of data generation for RAG systems. I’ve come up with an idea that I believe can solve this problem effectively—not just for my current company but for any organization that relies on document-based systems.

Here’s the situation:
- The idea is not specific to my company; it’s a general solution that could benefit various industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.

- I haven’t built anything yet, but I’ve started planning the product and am confident it could work.

- My current employment contract likely restricts me from working on side projects without disclosure.

I’m torn between two options:
- Stay at my job and work on the idea as a side project: This would allow me to validate the idea without taking a big financial risk. However, it feels slow, and I’m concerned about any potential conflict with my employer.

- Quit my job and go all-in on the startup: This would give me the freedom to focus entirely on the idea, but it’s a big leap, and I’d need to rely on my savings until the startup gains traction.

For context:
- I have savings to support myself (single no kids) for a 1 year.

- I’m passionate about solving this problem and feel this idea has real potential.

- I want to act ethically and ensure I’m not violating any legal agreements.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I quit my job and take the risk, or try to balance both until the idea gains traction?

Any advice, experiences, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1hbnnwg,How to Crush Facebook Ads with a Small Budget,"Running Facebook ads successfully with a small budget is not only possible but often recommended for new advertisers. Starting small allows you to minimize financial risk while learning the platform and optimizing campaigns. Here's a step-by-step guide to maximizing results on a tight budget.

# Defining a Small Budget

* **Small Budget**: Less than $3,300 per month (\~$100/day).
* **Tiny Budget**: Less than $600 per month (\~$20/day).

Starting small is wise because initial campaigns might not perform well. Once profitable, you can scale confidently.

# 1. Copy What Works Best in Your Industry

With limited funds, avoid testing too many variables. Instead:

* Use the **Meta Ads Library** (free tool) to analyze competitors' ads.
* Focus on ads that have been running for months; these are likely successful.
* Model your ads on these examples, including style, format, and language, but avoid outright copying.

Shortcut your success by leveraging others' testing efforts.

# 2. Reduce the Number of Variables

* Focus on selling **one product or service** at a time, preferably:
   * Your best-selling item.
   * The item with the highest profit margin.
* Keep campaigns simple with fewer ad sets and ads.

This approach helps Meta gather sufficient data and optimizes performance faster.

# 3. Trust Meta’s Algorithms

Rely on tools like **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns** or **Advantage+ Audiences** to let Meta optimize targeting and placement. Avoid experimental tactics that could risk your small budget.

Meta’s systems are designed to deliver results, especially when campaigns align with platform recommendations.

# 4. Be Willing to Spend More on Conversions

Set realistic expectations for return on ad spend (ROAS):

* For beginners, aiming for a **2x–4x ROAS** is reasonable.
* Aggressively spend up to your break-even point to gain initial customers.

The goal is not immediate profitability but scaling, gathering conversion data, and building brand awareness for long-term success.

# 5. Avoid Brand Awareness Campaigns

For small budgets:

* Focus on **lead generation** or **sales campaigns**.
* Avoid vague objectives like ""getting your business out there.""

Exception: **Omnipresent content strategies** can work for small audiences but are niche-specific.

# 6. Avoid Constantly Tweaking Campaigns

Frequent adjustments reset the **learning phase**, hindering optimization. To maximize success:

* Allow campaigns to run for a sufficient period to gather data.
* Adjust based on **conversion volume**, not arbitrary timeframes.

Smaller budgets mean longer learning phases, so patience is key.

# 7. Niche Down Your Audience

Target a specific subsection of your market to:

* Tailor messaging effectively.
* Stand out from generic ads targeting broad audiences.

For example, instead of marketing broadly, position yourself as a specialist in a specific industry, like SaaS businesses. Expand gradually as you scale.

# 8. Embrace New Features and Strategies

Leverage your small business agility by quickly adopting:

* New Meta features.
* Innovative ad strategies.

Larger companies often move slower due to complex decision-making processes, giving smaller advertisers a competitive advantage.

# Conclusion

Running Facebook ads with a small budget requires strategic planning and patience. By focusing on what works, trusting Meta’s tools, and avoiding common pitfalls, you can achieve success and scale your campaigns over time. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your results grow.",0,startups,1733899607.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbnnwg/how_to_crush_facebook_ads_with_a_small_budget/

my cofounder and i are 2-man team. he is the tech and i am the marketing/growth. i came up with the idea last week, pitched it to him, he built it in 2 days, and we dropped it. no posts on reddit, no paid ads, no influencers or creators, just by asking and making friends. our goal for this specific project is to grow and build a community around it. it aint gonna make us millions but what's valuable is the platform and users we'll be able to reach.

here are few tips to tech founders who lack marketing and sales:

\- build a brand or build a persona online but have a presence

\- interact with soon to be users/customers ahead of time but don't give off corporate/sales vibes, make friends

\- build relationships with your users ahead of time, months ahead ideally but weeks works.

\- always ask, the worst thing a person can say is ""no"", don't be afraid of rejection or being ignored or ghosted

these tips would be your generic tips for any startup, depending on the industry and audience, u'd have to think outside the box.

1hbn3hx,Idea Validation - Ever spent hours wrestling with data from a PDF or invoice? ,"You know the drill: someone sends you a file, and suddenly it’s *your job* to extract all the data manually. Copy-pasting, fixing formatting issues, and double-checking everything. By the time you’re done, you’re wondering why it felt like such a monumental waste of time.

I’ve been there. And honestly? It’s what inspired me to start building a solution.

Here’s the idea:  
Imagine a tool where you can upload *any* document—PDFs, invoices, contracts, whatever—and it extracts all the important data into a clean, editable table in seconds no OCR training effort required, you just tell what you want to extract regardless of the format and it does it for you.

But that’s not all. You could:

* Edit or add custom notes/fields right there.
* Automate the next steps (send data to your CRM, shoot off an email, etc.).
* Validate data through a custom API or save it directly into your database.

Basically, it’s about turning that painful grunt work into an automated workflow. No coding. No headaches. Just fast, clean data you can actually use.

Now, I would like to validate the idea, how do you guys feel about this?

1hbdfhb,5 ways content marketing has changed over the last decade,"I've been in the digital marketing game since 2010, mostly focusing on startups and e-commerce. As I've been prepping to launch a new project, it’s striking just how much the industry has changed over the last decade—and how few of the tactics I would have employed in 2015 are even remotely relevant today.

And since one of my core marketing skills has always been wasting time on Reddit, I thought I’d put some of my thoughts together in a post to see if this tracks with other folks’ experiences.

Here are five ways I’ve seen content marketing evolve over the last decade. What did I miss?

**1. Organic social reach for written content has collapsed**

One of the first startups I worked with built a sizable audience on Facebook simply by creating and sharing fun, engaging blog content. At its peak, this company could post an intriguing blog link and consistently count on tens of thousands of clicks without spending any money on boosting it at all. This was the era of BuzzFeed quizzes, endless listicles, and content designed—for better or worse— to appease the clickbait gods.

But in the mid-to-late 2010s, Facebook introduced changes that completely killed this strategy. Organic reach for links was throttled, while content that kept users on the platform (like videos and native posts) was rewarded. Look up the infamous “pivot to video” for an illustration of how this impacted media brands. For more check out Cory Doctorow’s concept of “enshittification,” a pattern that continues to today.

**2. SEO Is more competitive, niche, and less gameable**

When I first started in marketing, the SEO playbook was riddled with black-hat tactics: keyword stuffing, low-effort link farms, duplicate sites—you name it. But then Google got hip and rolled out a series of algorithm updates that penalized low-quality tactics. Some clients I worked with lost half their SEO traffic overnight as various core algo updates rolled out.

Since then, Google has continued to bang the drum that all it wants is high-quality, useful content that fills the needs of the person searching. Of course, this is not a bad thing, and in-depth, original, and niche content that truly addresses search intent should be rewarded. What's challenging is that over this same period, it's become increasingly difficult to ""win"" at SEO as Google has stuffed its SERPs with ads and new features like those recent AI summaries. SEO remains one of the only viable content channels for startups, but in many ways, it's more competitive and more difficult than ever.

**3. Mobile-first everything**

Even the most professional UX designers (working as they do from their 27-inch monitors) can forget that most web traffic comes from mobile devices. It’s no longer enough for your site to be mobile-friendly—it has to be mobile-first. This has been as much of a change for marketers as it has been for devs and designers. After all, the experience that someone has when landing on mobile page can make or break every one of your marketing metrics and channels.  

**4. The ascent of vertical video**

If you're reading this, than you already know that the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels has fundamentally reshaped content consumption. Vertical video has become the dominant format, and its influence extends far beyond these platforms. Since these apps are more about keeping users on the app than driving them to external links. This shift forces marketers to rethink how they approach content creation. Instead of using social media as a referral engine, it’s all about building brand awareness and engaging directly with audiences. And even this has already started to become more difficult (see again, ""enshittification"").

**5. The AI revolution (and/or apocalypse)**

Finally, there’s the six-fingered elephant in the room: AI. The rise of tools like ChatGPT et al has already transformed content marketing workflows with new AI-driven tools cropping up every day. While we’re still in the early days of the AI revolution, it’s clear that this isn’t just a fad. AI will continue to reshape how marketers create, distribute, and measure content. I mean, I bet people are reading this post right now who think that it's AI-generated (I swear, it's not though I did use GPT to proofread).

1haw07b,Anyone else here have autism / auditory processing disorder (APD) and find going to parties and networking hard?,"I moved back to the bay area from CO primarily because I wanted to do another startup in the AI space.

The problem is I really forgot how much I hate networking and going to parties.

I also have auditory processing disorder (APD) which makes it much harder for me to have discussions in rooms when music is playing or lots of people are taking.

It effectively makes going to super cool events almost pointless to me.

Now I LOVE talking to smart people so if I can hear them I really enjoy it but it's usually in smaller meetings or when people are outside.  

The problem is that this is most of the events I go to.  It's just such a cacophony I can't really focus and just want to leave.

I thought maybe one strategy would be to organize my OWN events that I design to be ideal for me to hear. Like going for hikes or over dinner. Something like that.

Any advice would be awesome!

I'm considering just giving up on it and focusing on TikTok / Youtube because at least I can talk to a lot of people this way.",6,startups,1733813693.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1haw07b/anyone_else_here_have_autism_auditory_processing/
1hbdz5s,$5.. forever? 😏,"👋🏼 Over the past year, I’ve been diving into software development and product management. Most of my projects have been ambitious and complex (read: nowhere near finished), so I decided to tackle something smaller to gain practical experience.

Recently, I needed to organize my finances for an upcoming move. Instead of creating yet another Google Sheet, I thought, Why not build a simple tool for myself? 🙃

What began as a quick personal project quickly escalated. In just a few days, I developed a full app, complete with a licensing system and a (barebones) marketing site. It’s been a fun learning journey, and it feels great to have something tangible out there instead of endlessly tinkering.

The app is straightforward—it’s an offline finance tool that stores data locally and helps plan finances without relying on bank integrations. While it’s not groundbreaking, it serves my needs and avoids the hassle of dealing with miscategorized transactions.

Here’s where I deviated from the norm: I opted for a $5 lifetime license instead of the typical subscription model. I understand that subscriptions are standard in SaaS, and this approach likely won’t make me rich. However, I wanted to experiment with simplicity and see if a one-time price could still attract interest.

So far, a few sales have come in, boosting my confidence. But I’m curious: Does this kind of pricing make sense for small, low-maintenance tools like this? Or am I missing the mark by not adopting the subscription model?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this pricing experiment and any similar experiences you’ve had. Thanks for reading!",0,startups,1733869091.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbdz5s/5_forever/

We are in the early stages of iterating on a Personalised Health LLM and we have been testing it with target users via Google Meets. I've mostly been transcribing their feedback manually **as they speak**, but I rather be freeing up that 40% brain capacity, better interacting with them and asking them better follow-ups questions.

I tried Quicktime recording, to no avail as audio didn't come through for whatever reason. Any recs? I'd need the record the: 

* Meeting screen (ie Google Meet presenter's)
* My audio
* Tester's audio

Ideal Output: mp4/mov video and transcript. Gladly take a duct tape solution if I could keep cost zilch.

1hb3vc6,Customer Success software? ,"Hi!

I've noticed a lot of sales/CRM platforms work primarily on sales funnel and conversions; mostly to close deals. But I've been looking for 'post sales', basically making sure customers onboard properly, use the products the right way etc. I've worked in the past with a couple of larger, more mature startups who predominantly went with enterprise level customers and they're using jury-rigged CRMs to manage those relationships. So they make sure they're touching base with them and they essentially create new 'pipelines' and triggers to check in with a customer if they haven't in a while or if the customer makes a certain action.

I've found what I've been looking at is essentially account management and customer success, but there doesn't appear to many tools specifically for this area. Where they are they're looking purely at retention and churn rather than relationship building and upsell. Am I in a bit of a bubble because of the startups I've worked with, or is this just an area that doesn't get that much focus?",1,startups,1733843363.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hb3vc6/customer_success_software/

It was such a huge work as it was something which was pretty complicated in general to build from scratch but I managed to pull it off anyway.

How is it different from competition ? 
I address one pain point specifically: Existing tools are complicated as sh*t. They not only provide 1000000 useless features, but the UI has a million different buttons doing a million different things and it is soooooooo overwhelming. 
I have tried to make my tool EXTREMELY simple. The UI is really soothing and I got good feedback for it.

1ha5uzg,These are the 27 books I have read in 2024 as a founder,"Hello founders,

1hafrv8,Your thoughts on fractional CXOs?,"I was a startup CTO (and co-founder) but after a long 8 year grind I decided to step down. Main reason: the company entered a new phase with main focus on sales and scaling with much less innovation. Came to a point where I simply felt done and started to hate my job.

Took the company from 0 to 1 and grew product and engineering teams from 3 to 40 people. After stepping down I got a handful of offers from other startups but politely declined and took a well-needed sabbatical. Wasn't mentally ready to commit to a new journey just yet. A fellow CTO friend suggested that I try consulting as Fractional CTO. Loved the idea and the flexibility but quickly noticed that the majority of smaller and early-stage startups had tiny budgets and were looking for a lead engineer and not a CTO. While I do love to code I also love to lead people and build teams and culture. 

I understand that you can't bring in a fractional CTO if your company already has a CTO but I also see many in this sub looking for a technical co-founder. In my head, a fractional CTO is the perfect candidate. It's the least risky way to try work together and see if there is personal chemistry and vibe. If we enjoy working together and I believe in the idea I would even strongly consider joining the team if offered. 

On to my question:

I am still figuring out my ICP and where to find the right people (Linkedin sucks ) and wanted to ask people here what their views on fractionals are in general. Have you worked with any? In what phase? If not, did you consider it? Why not?

Please share your honest thoughts, experiences, and of course, opinions!

1hao27x,Thoughts on this idea for a student-focused ticket marketplace?,"

Thoughts on this idea for a student ticket p2p


is is an (albeit not very original) small idea I've had over the past day, looking to see if it would be viable on a small scale.

Essentially, I'm a college student that's noticed that the ticket market is kinda fucked for alot of students, particularly for reselling and ticket exchanges, students often have to go through WhatsApp in groups, there are alot of scams, and it's not very secure.

the central idea of this is a student-centred p2p marketplace to buy, sell and exchange tickets for (mainly) student events. It could potentially partner with different student groups and societies on campuses, exclusive pre-sale access, possibly local venue partnerships as well, for student discounts of early-bird pricing. There would be price-caps to prevent extreme scalping, and two-factor authenticators using student ID to keep out fraudulent activity.

Revenue generation could come from a small transaction fees, subscription plans, advertising etc. 

There are alot of different ticket apps out there right now, what sets this idea apart is the focus on students and alleviate their specific pain-points. what do you think?",0,startups,1733787955.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hao27x/thoughts_on_this_idea_for_a_studentfocused_ticket/

I have been working at a startup for a couple of months as the founding engineer brought on. Our MVP has been built and started making money but there are no outside investors currently. I have done a significant amount of work on the backend for free due to having a personal relationship with one of the founders and it's more fun than my day job. I am trying to figure out what my expectations should be for equity now that the legal papers are finished.

We are currently bootstrapped and unsure if investors will be needed. The current equity situation has 25% designated for employees and investors - they want to give me 5-6% because they say that investors will be unlikely to invest if given more equity than this and that 5-6% is already triple the market value for equity for an employee (if we had any money to give me a salary as well).

I feel like because I am working for free and will probably be working for free for the next months / year currently that I should be in the range of 10-15%, but I got the sense that they thought this was unreasonable.

1hamrkm,startup ios name advice,"for context im building an ios app in a niche area and i came up with a pretty creative and name that i love - it’s directly related to the niche im building and its a simple but memorable name.

the only problem is that there is someone else in the same niche space who had a similar idea to me with the same name on the App Store. they seem like a small builder with a history of making two apps, but the app im talking about only has 2 reviews for stars and hasn’t been updated in over a year.

even though i am in the same space as the other app and planned to use the name in a fun unique way like the other app, my apps execution is completely different from design to function (even though they address the same problem)

im not that worried about the other app impacting my new apps search because even the other app doesn’t show up in the top 3 for its name - so if people love what I build im hoping my search results will be much better

my main issue right now is that I’ve fallen in love with the name. I came up with it when I first was building the app and now im really really disappointed a very small outdated app has the same one.

I know names don’t mean everything but this one I felt meant a lot as a ios app where the name is also tied to the meaning and ways to market / distribute the app.

there’s no trademark on the name I checked - would you recommend me still using the same name? I know apple has a strict policy but im hoping my execution and actual final product being much better and unique can be enough (especially since the other app hasn’t been updated or used much)

1ha6q7c,"Story about ""re-starting"" successful startup","I have been working on a startup related to 3D printer management. Over the last few years, this segment has changed a lot—new competitors have appeared, and we’re slowly achieving nice numbers in terms of users and new subscriptions.

A year ago, we realized that instead of focusing on creating precise solutions to integrate all 3D printers into our software, the real focus should be on the process itself—the workflow of how 3D models are created and prepared for printing. We always thought we needed to create an end-to-end solution, from the moment the 3D model is created to the time the printer starts working. But this is an incredibly complex problem as a whole, and not all parts of it need solving.

Our biggest target group right now is schools, where the process begins in the classroom with students and their projects. They create a model, send it for review to the teacher, schedule it for printing alongside others, and finally, it gets printed. Interestingly, the last part—the actual printing, which is the most difficult from a ""technical"" perspective—is the least important in the process.

We tried to implement all these steps into our application, but in the end, we built a very complex piece of software that didn’t solve the most critical parts of the workflow.

With all this in mind, I decided to leave this startup and start a new one, bringing with me all the experience and new perspectives I’ve gained. This time, I’m starting from the beginning—thinking before coding. I’m trying to adhere to all the concepts I know exist, but as someone ""over-experienced,"" I sometimes skipped steps in the past. Now, I’m learning to share my ideas publicly, I’ve created a ""signup waitlist"" page for my new startup, and I’m genuinely excited to see how things unfold.

This time, I want to truly enjoy the startup journey. I feel like I have more space, time, and the opportunity to do things properly. And who knows—maybe in the future, my ""old startup"" will evolve into the new one, solving old problems from a fresh perspective.

I just wanted to share this mindset change. It’s been incredibly liberating to leave behind the ""full bag"" that was weighing me down and embrace this ""light running.""",10,startups,1733739748.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ha6q7c/story_about_restarting_successful_startup/

 However, do you think it’s also common that they would value the team because they produced good work in the past, and could hopefully produce more good things/expand the application?  

I can see it being necessary to keep on some of the engineers to perform maintenance, train other staff, incorporate into the other company.  

The reason I’m asking this is because I’m trying to help understand how our current sass company can position itself for acquisition. My CEO seems to think that having the **potential** to solve more market problems (eg by leveraging the current platform, and because the team has a history of some innovative solutions) is something valuable.  Me on the other hand, I feel like the current platform with all his current abilities, is what the only real value that any potential buyer would care about.

1h9v6dj,Technical founder here - What's your take on outsourcing MVP development? How much would you pay?,"

Hey fellow founders,

As a technical founder who's been in the startup ecosystem for a while, I've noticed a significant rise in MVP development agencies. While I can code, I've been wondering about the general sentiment around outsourcing MVP development, especially given time constraints and the need to focus on other aspects of the business.

I'm curious:

1. Would you consider hiring someone to build your MVP, even as a technical founder? Why or why not?

2. The big question - what's your threshold for MVP development cost? What would you consider a reasonable budget for a solid MVP? (I'm seeing ranges from $5K to $50K+ and honestly not sure what's reasonable anymore)

Would love to hear from those who've gone this route:
- What did you pay?
- Was it worth it?
- Any regrets?

Also, if you chose NOT to outsource, I'd love to hear your reasoning.

P.S. Not looking to outsource right now, just trying to understand the market dynamics and what other founders think is a fair price point for MVP development.",47,startups,1733698334.0,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9v6dj/technical_founder_here_whats_your_take_on/
1hanls4,"Our New Facebook Ads Strategy that made us 7.5 ROAS
","Dude this was crazy!  
  
This is how we've been consistently generating 5-10 ultra qualified. leads per day for our SaaS using facebook ads and conditional logic  
  
We used to struggle because our ads tend to attract a lot of ""wannabe entrepreneurs"" that would sign up then cancel the next month because their business wasn't running yet  
  
Now we attract only people that already have a running business and are looking for a better tool to do their everyday priority tasks  
  
**First - The Ad creatives**  
  
You know, your Saas should be a better alternative to a pre-existing method of executing an everyday task   
  
The idea is: your customer needs to execute a few tasks everyday that are essential for the business to run  
  
Simple example: the uber driver has to drive towards the clients pickup spot  
  
Your Saas should be a superior tool when compared to the traditional method (example: chainsaw vs. hacksaw)  
  
Your facebook ad creative should be a video announcing the viewer that your tool exists and that you're capable of performing XYZ tasks faster and/or cheaper. That's it.  
  
Try to use an instagram Reel format.   
  
**Second - The ad form**  
  
Our biggest shift here was to use facebook's native form.  
  
We plugged it into a google sheets spreadsheet and the form answers  come automatically into the spreadsheet.  
  
But what changed it all was using the ""conditional logic"" feature.  
  
Basically, when you turn it on, you can choose one or more questions that will define an answer as ""qualified"" or not.  
  
So now facebook will only consider those types of answers as an actual ""lead"".  
  
**THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING**  
  
Last month we spent 4k in ads and generated 30k in revenue.  
  
This month we managed to reduce the cost per lead to 1/3rd, plus we doubled our daily ad spend so we're excited for that.  
  
That was only possible due to the increase in lead quality that allowed us to have 24k paid in fulls (2 year contract)   
  
Facebook's native lead form also allowed👉 us to have cheaper leads without losing quality of leads.   
👉I suspect this happened because when the traffic goes to your website facebook have a hard time to track it, but with the native lead form, this is no problem since the traffic is still in facebook.  
  
So recap:  
  
\- your ad creative should attack the inferior alternative to your Saas product  
\- use facebook's native form with the conditional logic turned ON  
\- get Rich

1hacs3q,Finding investors for consumer app,"
Hi,

I'm a technical founder (incorporated) for a new friend and date-finding app launching in Vancouver, Canada. Before you roll your eyes, I want to say that this is near and dear to my heart. So much so that I want to change the industry by offering the most important features for free and significantly undercut popular apps. There will be in-app purchases, yes. But I want to give the people the tools they need to find what they are looking for.

The MVP for iOS and Android is 70% done, and now I'm looking for potential investors to get this off the ground. The expensive part will be chat and database fees, as well as initial marketing in Vancouver (where it will be launched first), to make people aware of the app.

I'm new to all this, and I've learned a lot. But I have no clue how to find and approach people with money, that want to invest in a b2c app.

I would appreciate any tips, contacts, etc. Slide deck available. 

Thanks.

1h9kdd2,Gross Revenue Sharing? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all doing well.   
  
A few months ago, I was researching effective ways to distribute revenue to early business partners in a startup. Specifically, I explored methods like compensating people with equity instead of a salary. During my research though, I found that many individuals who chose to accept equity over a salary in various startups later regretted their decision. A common reason was that some founders often found creative ways to avoid paying dividends. I came across this issue repeatedly through blogs and videos shared by people who experienced it firsthand.   
  
And even if the founders are trustworthy, a late-stage investor with a majority share could intentionally structure the company's finances to ensure profits are funneled toward their own interests, so that early contributors are left with nothing.

After doing some more research, however, I discovered this amazing thing called 'Gross Revenue Sharing'. Gross revenue sharing is a contractual agreement where payouts are based on the gross revenue—the total income a company earns before any expenses are deducted—rather than profits made. 

For example, an agreement might stipulate that if you work for the company for a specific period (say, five years) and meet a clear set of predetermined goals year after year, you will receive a fixed percentage of gross revenue (e.g., 0.001%) annually for the next 50 years(or whatever other number of years would be fair). This ensures a guaranteed reward that is not subject to potentially manipulated profit margins.

This way seems much safer and more secure than the usual equity or profit-sharing deals. And that's why I wanted to ask, with all these benefits, it makes me wonder why gross revenue sharing isn’t more common in the tech industry. Is it because people don’t know about it, doubt it would work, or is there another reason?",9,startups,1733669306.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kdd2/gross_revenue_sharing/

1h9vcrh,Investor Search and Responses,"I do SaaS fintech b2b. Very long sales cycles traditionally. I tried to raised $1M in a seed round back in Oct '23. First time Founder (but with 10years xp in my industry) and it was terrible. Wasted 6 months figuring out how to talk to these dummies.

At the time I had 3 clients which is big in my space, most startups fail to get the first client. I ended up only getting $400K, 1 check from a VC and 1 from an existing client. The VC is cool, but when they made intros to their friends it fell apart. The biggest feedback was that they didn't feel that the product was ""defence-able"".

On average, large competitors close 2-3 deals a month with a whole sales team and a marketing team. Solo, I did matched by myself. My product is just 10x better and I know how to sell. 

I now have 15 clients and those will be roughly ~ $1M arr once fully implemented. 3 of 12 major competitors are pulling out of the industry because they suck and the business is too tough for them. I need to take their market share in '25. 

My last VC is in for $500k again, term sheet in hand. 3 clients are pitching in $250k combined. The VC however wants me to raise atleast $1M this time however. (We agree on this number, but it's not necessary for me but they think it is). 

So. I hate talking to VC. I have very little tolerance for them taking time away from my family and my clients. How do I go back previous VC that passed and tell them to give me money in as few words as possible? 

Plan B, is to shoot a text out to all the other start-up CEOs I have made friends with over the last decade, and tell them know I need $250K to round out a $1M raise and see who's going to do me a solid a make an intro. 

If I go outside my existing network, do I have to actually make a pitch deck? Or can I get away without that, or half-ass it. Really don't want to spend the hours to make it perfect. I expect to grow to $5M ARR next year and grow faster than any other company in the space. But I won't do that if I waste my time begging folks for money over Zoom. 

Looking for advice or to vent. The VC world borderline doesn't make sense to me. Why make 100 phone calls to raise $250K and when I make 100 phone calls to earn $1M arr?

1h9kczb,Hesitate if I should release my app that has an major defect.,"Here is the background story. I made an app
that help people to learn music staff. The app will show a note on the screen and let users play it, then, it will listen to what users are playing and compute the frequency via a pitch detection algorithm. If the user does play the right note, he will gain a score. The problem is, the algorithm, provided by a small open source library, suffers from octave error. That is, it will give you doubled or half frequency of the pitch that the user's playing, and this situation happens quite often. This make the app produce falsy result. For example, the app shows a A4 note (the frequency is 440hz), and when a user plays a A3 note (the frequency is 220hz), there is a great chance the app thinks the user plays the right note, because the algorithm outputs a false doubled frequency of what the user's playing (A3). To fix this problem requires lots of efforts for me. Either I have to try different open source libraries and evaluate them, or even write my own algorithm. It is really time-consuming.

As what Learn Startup says, I should build a MVP ASAP and find out whether it is what my customers want, so I am considering to release my app now, even it is far from perfect. However I am also fear that releasing an app with such obvious defect will give them a really bad impression about the app. Since I am going to promote the app to music teachers near my place, and I think it is not easy to find one that is willing to try my app, if they dislike it because of the defect, they won't become my users and give me feedback, and I won't know if the app idea is viable. However if I choose to solve to octave error, I might end up wasting time, since I don't know if people need it. Now I really don't know what should I do.",4,startups,1733669273.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kczb/hesitate_if_i_should_release_my_app_that_has_an/
1h94egx,Incentives sound low to join as a founding engineer,"Assuming you get a 4 year vesting schedule and say the company it gets acquired in M&amp;A deal the year or two after you join. Then what's the buyers incentive for keeping the upside on employee equity vs just reducing it to market based compensation?

Example an employee takes a haircut in pay to join a startup, that does well and gets acquired. The employee may have turned their 400k grant to 2M with 2 years left to vest. The acquiring company can determine this is overpaying and reduce their compensation to market pay - let's say 250k stock per year instead of 500K. 

Wouldn't this be less incentive to join a startup vs the alternative of big tech (which will have “uncapped” upside on stock growth + annual refreshers). 

Edit: assuming you can’t get a single trigger and double trigger only covers termination instead of pay cut. Terms can be renegotiated anyway, so there's not much gurantee.",42,startups,1733611682.0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h94egx/incentives_sound_low_to_join_as_a_founding/

1h9347e,I Scaled Two E-Commerce Brands to $1M in Annual Revenue Simultaneously within 2 Years — Here's My Story,"I wanted to share my journey of scaling *two* e-commerce brands to $1M in annual revenue at the same time within two years. It wasn’t easy, and I didn’t follow some “perfect formula.” My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I’m not sharing this as an attempt to “gain karma” or whatever and I’m not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here’s the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I’d “made it.” Spoiler: I hadn’t.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started—broke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I’d ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. “This is it,” I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn’t last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he’d quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in “Print on Demand” platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn’t know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn’t about print on demand—it was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1️⃣ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2️⃣ Make it higher quality.  
3️⃣ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she’s the skeptical type, but she was on board—which made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1️⃣ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it’s not great, it won’t last.  
2️⃣ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3️⃣ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn’t have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here’s the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you’re stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

“The difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it’s literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it’s a choice.”  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It’s up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

1h9j8ie,Insect feed startup in latam (I need a plan),"I have a small business in a Latin American country that produces red runner roaches, mealworms, Zophobas, some black soldier fly larvae, and crickets. All are currently at small-scale levels but with the capacity for growth. I’m a science student and know how to produce them, but I lack expertise in business.

I have some leadership experience from directing a grassroots movement and have many friends and connections, mostly in Latin America and Europe. I currently live in Lisbon and know some people working in venture capital who could help with funding. I also know scientists and professionals from various developing nations from my time at a major international science center, as well as some local politicians and a friend with a farm in Italy.

I feel like I have the conditions to succeed and grow a successful business. However, what’s limiting us is that both my business partner and I are more focused on biology and science. My partner has a BSc in biology, works in wildlife conservation (birds), and raises cattle. I’m a physicist studying evolution and biology, specifically yeastcell biology. Despite our skills, we struggle to concentrate on growing the business.

Right now, we’re making around $65 in small monthly sales, while I pay $130 and my associate $200 out of pocket to cover food for the insects and electricity. Some tasks, like producing more insects, are easier than building something like an oven to dry them.

Our goals include:

• Increasing sales

• Producing our own chicken feed

• Selling compost as a by-product

• Entering the biotech market with products like chitosan

Currently, we have one part-time employee and occasionally hire a second person on a day-to-day basis. I want to hire a friend with extensive entomology experience who worked at a mealworm startup (to which I sold the original colony for $3k), but I can’t afford to hire him full-time. I’m considering paying him a daily rate and having him work a few times a month.

I’d like to buy a solar dryer to start prototyping chicken feed with the BSF but feel unsure about how to move forward. I also own two generic domain names but think we need a better business name. I believe we should create a LinkedIn page, ask friends to share on social media, and build our presence online.

1h9s097,Repost with more info: How do I show tens of ideas for cofounders to choose without getting my ideas stolen?,"Ok, let me repost this because I didn't explain and obviously it went out of control: people went with the usual ""Nobody will steal your ideas"" or the ""idea is nothing without execution”.

Please read, and I hope you can help me.

Hi guys, I have lots of startup ideas and I was wondering which was the best way to share these ideas with possible technical cofounders for them to choose without getting my ideas exposed.

The goal would be to create a startup lab where students and new devs can pick and choose what they want to develop (based on their skills and experience) to learn how to be a startupper and be guided by this lab.

I already received green light from the townhall and our university that will allocate resources to fund this lab and the ideas that will be born from it.

Trust me, if I just wanted to make money it would be much easier to just gather investors and launch the ideas in the list starting from the best to the worst but I'm not doing this for money, at least not only for that.
I genuinely want to do good, I want to create something that will help people create new things and new companies in this new environment where they’re guided, without the risk of more experienced startuppers or software houses stealing the “formative” work.

I could talk literally for hours about this thing but please trust me that I'm not a random guy that just wants to protect his ideas while he talks to devs.

So going back to the “problem”:

Obviously I can't make them sign NDAs for tens, maybe even a hundred, of ideas, and I can't even make them sign a single NDA for all of them because then the contract won't be specific enough.

1h8g50t,I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer,"Had a beer with a buddy of mine the other day—he’s a CRO at a 130-person tech startup. Out of nowhere, he’s like, “Man, I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer.” Not gonna lie, I laughed at first, but then I realized he was dead serious.

So I ask him what’s up, and he just starts venting. He said the hardest part is he feels like he’s supposed to know everything that’s happening in the company, but it’s impossible. Marketing’s doing one thing, sales is doing another, and customer success is in their own little world. And somehow, he’s supposed to connect all the dots and make the revenue grow?

Then he talks about how he has all these big plans—like where they need to be in 6 months, how they should be scaling, all that good stuff.

He said it feels like no matter how much effort he puts in, something’s always slipping through the cracks.

His exact words: “It’s like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it’s lost deals and missed opportunities. And I’m the only one holding the hammer.”

Honestly, it sounded rough, and it got me wondering—do other CROs feel this way too?

If you’re a CRO (or close to one), what’s the hardest part of your job? Is it the lack of visibility, the struggle to get stuff done, or something else? 

Would love to hear how you deal with it.

1h8pt5k,Cold email works! here's my experience/recommended tools,"I’ve been sending cold email outreach - both for sales of my PR agency and database and to contact journalists/creators on behalf of clients - for around 3 months now.

Stone cold. Zero prior relationship. At massive scale (with AI).

And I was skeptical. But guess what? It works.

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I’ve learnt a ton so far that’s helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don’t rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

Google Workspace  
Apollo  
Coldsire  
Clay  
Instantly

If you’re not cold email outreach with AI, try it! You’d be surprised. Happy to answer more specific questions.",15,startups,1733567604.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h8pt5k/cold_email_works_heres_my_experiencerecommended/
1h8tnov,Seeking advice on having transparent discussions about early-stage startup ideas,"(Sorry about the robotic sounding text - I basically word vomited into Claude and had to clean up my thoughts for me. Appreciate any help!)

  
I'm an aspiring entrepreneur discussing some AI product ideas with potential customers and engineers to get feedback. My goal is to have open and collaborative conversations but also ensure everyone is on the same page regarding roles and expectations.

I want to avoid situations where someone thinks they deserve equity or ownership just for providing input. However, I also really value these relationships and don't want them to sour due to misunderstandings. Protecting the work is important but maintaining trust and goodwill is equally critical.

I'm looking for advice from other founders on how to strike the right balance:

* What's the best way to communicate upfront to avoid incorrect expectations?
* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

My aim is to build strong, productive connections while being transparent. I don't want to be overly guarded but also want to mitigate the risk of misunderstandings that could undermine trust.

I’m pricing the online community in two membership tiers. One oriented towards aspiring students thinking about entering a specific field, and existing students across 15 or so US universities at a price point to $49.95 a month. The next tier is professional level, existing community members in early to mid career, looking to connect with professionals in the industry at a price point of $99 a month.

Those who are in this industry are fairly affluent. It is hard to enter the industry, and 99% of those who do go through a masters program. 

Building critical mass early is important. I’ve thought about, but I’ve decided not to offer a free tier. My concern being that the community is flooded with wannabes and ultimately would devalue the community. 

I’m trying to solve for Network effect. I currently do not have any members.

I thought about offering coupon codes to industry insiders they could pass out to others to join that would provide for a period of free access to the site so long as they use a credit card to sign up. I thought about swag after the second month of payment. I’m going to be using an affiliate program , so any new users can refer others for a percentage of the revenue. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for solving Network effect for niche communities? Any reading or other ideas people have seen?

We have been good friends for a while and always talked here and there about starting a company. I kind of stopped the ""talking"" and got to work and a week or two later told my friend that hey this is what I have been working on and we agreed to do it together.  I am CEO and he joined as CTO. 

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could! 

  
TLDR: 2 week hire wants to be CFO (they are good at what they do so far) what is the best way to judge if they are suitable and what would be a good compensation model for them given they are not a cofounder?

This results in startups spending way too much time on flashy competitions and endless programs, and way less time actually running their businesses. There is only so many competitions you can go to before you actually need to start selling to customers.

• Build skills working on real world project and also earn money doing so.

• Even as a beginner, start with free projects to earn points and earn enough points to apply for paid projects.

1h91q7g,I’m building an open source AI marketing bot that you can run for FREE (using Ollama),"We all know how valuable Reddit is for shilling your product (just look at this sub). A lot of founders are using it to promote their products.

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I’ve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it’s so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I’ve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I’ve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don’t deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I’m basically running it for free.

Would be curious about if anyone would like to give it a try. I’m building it as an open source tool, but I don’t have any docs yet. So leave a comment for me to know there would be interest and I’ll write docs so you can run it yourself.

1h892yq,"I launched my MVP, started with the sales. This is what I found out:","Spoiler: I am not able to make a sale, and I don't see it as a bad thing.

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

imagine deciding to check product, go to their website, and it looks scammy, it is loading super slowly, and the main title is bs. 90% of people already dropped out. idk how it works for u, but i, and people that i talked with agree that if website looks modern, is fast and done properly, we check just because we are interested, and are more likely to check rest of the content and buy product.

what’s your take on that? how do you deal with marketing?

1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I’d love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team’s mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team’s energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project’s progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can’t do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important to recognize that. Admitting that you can’t do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it’s more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

I’m building a startup in the healthcare space focused on doctors, hospitals, and clinical trials.

I wanted to get your thoughts on a couple of key questions:
	1.	What is an attractive SOM for VCs in the healthcare space?
For example, is there a general SOM threshold (e.g., $100M, $200M, etc.) that investors find appealing?
	2.	What percentage of SOM should I ideally target to achieve within 5 years for it to be considered a strong and viable investment?
I’m trying to ensure my 5-year projections align with what VCs typically expect.

1h88f75,"How does vesting work for funded, single-founder companies?","What's the standard for vesting for single-founder startups?

For startups with more than one founder, I think it's reasonable to demand that both founders vest.

However, if you have a single founder, I wan't necessary planning to setup a vesting schedule for myself.

I think though, that if I take external investment, under *normal* terms that the VCs might insist.

I'm not sure what the normal situation is here though.

Do the investors force the single-founder to vest?

Now, I'm hoping to have really solid financials so I can at least have *some* leverage here.

Honestly, I'm sure some founders can get away with it if they have insane numbers.  

If you're 2 months old and making like $5M per year and 10000% month over month growth you can basically demand anything and the VCs will be down.

I’ve been dreaming of starting a startup for a while now. I even have some good ideas. But every time I think about starting, I feel stuck. It’s not like I don’t want to do it – I do! But some common problems keep holding me back.

Here’s what I’m dealing with:

* **No domain knowledge:** I know tech stuff, but when it comes to business things like marketing, finance, or even running a company, I’m clueless.

1h8glkz,I'm beyond fucked right now,"Hi, I'm 18M. A non technical founder. Since the past 4 months I've working on an online shopping app for my country, as there is a huge gap in the apps space here. I know zero coding and had hired a developer for cheap to develop the app for me, now the app is almost complete but i'm unsure about what i'll do for the maintenance of the app since the guy I was working with says that he'll be too busy to give it any tike. 

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code) 

I can either find someone to do maintenance for the app so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what's the procedure for that, what to keep in mind when hiring or giving access to the app, guidelines etc as I have zero tech knowledge. 

Also, if I hire a developer for maintenance, are there any chances he can like steal the app from me? like remove my access or anything (I'm already sorry if any of this sounds super silly) 

Another option I have is learn the basics myself and try to fix minor bugs myself if I come across any. Could you tell me how long would it take not to learn complete IOS or android development, but just simple maintenance or fixing bugs?

1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this. I talked with a lawyer friend who said that charging fees is pretty normal, but usually for basic work like this it's a much smaller fee. So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for! It feels a little like a tactic to minimize share transfers by former employees - they're taking it just because they have gatekeeping access. 

I had a great experience with the company and I'm super friendly with the people there still - how would you handle this? Is this something you've seen before? Should I just pay it and get it over with?

1h7k5e0,What I Wish I Did Sooner as a New Founder (Advice for You!),"**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here’s the one thing I’d do differently…**

**Document your journey.**

It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you’re working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here’s why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you’re deep in the grind, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you’ve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I’ve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I’ve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I’m bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I’ve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It’s one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you’re just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you’re doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you’re not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I’ve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

**Don’t wait. Start documenting today, even if it’s just for yourself, you’ll thank yourself later.**",25,startups,1733433519.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7k5e0/what_i_wish_i_did_sooner_as_a_new_founder_advice/

1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace — Do’s and Don’ts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don’t**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash’s founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don’t**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub’s early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **“Aha” Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don’t**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb’s Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace’s reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don’t**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors’ successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don’t**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace’s liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

1h87kt3,Carpooling could disrupt the cab industry.,"Carpooling has the potential to eat into the regularized cab industry, but it’s not yet structured or well-backed by tech.

We humans love connecting with qualified strangers, and carpooling can make that possible. Imagine an executive traveling 15 km to their company. Instead of a ride with an unknown driver, they can carpool with a consultant who’s been in the industry for 20-25 years. 

The value of such an exchange is immeasurable—valuable knowledge shared, strong networks built, and a higher level of security compared to rides with drivers from lower strata or remote areas.

To make this a reality, several things need to be fixed:

1.Quick Availability of Drivers: We need a large number of drivers ready to offer rides, ensuring easy availability.

2.Modernized Mobile App: A highly efficient app is key to seamlessly matching users and drivers.

3.Security: Carpooling with qualified professionals provides higher security compared to unknown drivers.

4.Networking Opportunities: It’s not just about getting from point A to B—it’s about building connections and learning from others during the ride.

Carpooling can be the game-changer in our commuting experience. Let’s take it to the next level!",0,startups,1733508338.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h87kt3/carpooling_could_disrupt_the_cab_industry/

1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I’m a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers—just a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we’d never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here’s what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki’s 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you’re a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it’s vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it’s a significant issue worth solving.

I’d follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I’d revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails—no friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* “This investor will drill into your TAM—make sure it’s airtight.”
* “Avoid using the term ‘AI agent’ with these firms.”

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there’s one thing I wish someone had told me: Don’t raise money in the summer.

1h7aic5,My friend's dad passed away and i am trying to help him.,"Hey Reddit, I’m here hoping to get some guidance from this amazing community.

A close friend of mine recently lost his father, and it’s been devastating for their family. His dad was involved in the alco-bev industry for over 20 years, co-running a company with a few partners. He wasn’t the technical guy, and played a key role in sales and relationships.

After his passing, the other founders have been trying to push my friend out of the company. It’s heartbreaking to see him struggle like this, especially since he now has the huge responsibility of providing for his family.

He’s trying to start his own business in the same field, focusing on importing Vatted Malt Spirit (VMS) from Scotland to India. The thing is, he doesn't know much about how this supply chain works or how to even get started. But he wants to continue in this field since his father accumulated a lot of good will in this industry and he kinda wants to continue his father's legacy.

If anyone has experience in the alco-bev industry, especially with Scottish distilleries or international supply chains, I would really appreciate your advice. My friend has lost so much already, and I just want to do everything I can to help him rebuild.

Thanks in advance for any insights or connections you can share. It would mean the world to both of us. 🙏",7,startups,1733409220.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7aic5/my_friends_dad_passed_away_and_i_am_trying_to/

1h7eo7c,PLEASE consider also other pricing options than Subscriptions,"A full time business/start up coach here! I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It’s been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here’s what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it. 

Bad: You’re critiquing humans, basically, so that’s tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends “I needed online dating help so I paid for it”? No customer retention because they’d get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site’s marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We’d review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out. 

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we’d have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it’s income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn’t make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I’m a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about. 

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect. 

It died because: I didn’t pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn’t know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don’t refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to “build a better mouse trap.”

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools. 

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating. 

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself. 

Bad: User acquisition wasn’t easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn’t pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500. 

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property. 

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don’t assume a company’s internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn’t jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales. 

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted…

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like “Vacord Industries, LLC.” and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just “Vacord” so the emails can be more like “Hey Jack, how’s your xyz at Vacord?” Instead of “Hey Jack, how’s xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?”

Good: People said they’d pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out. 

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:  There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again…

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn’t mean you’ll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It’s easier to market than anything else has been, and it’s got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say “I’m really glad we found your tool” is huge to me. 

Bad: It’s a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it’s growing slowly. I’m starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don’t be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you’re wasting your time and money building something that won’t work in the market.

\----

This isn’t even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing €75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

1h6r9vv,First 100 users for my app in a couple of weeks -Lessons learned so far,"It’s incredibly exciting to hit my first 100 users, and I’m especially proud because I did it without any paid advertising! Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You’re Solving** It’s easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else—fundraising, branding, or scaling—comes second to making sure you’re solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I’ve been building this while working a 9–5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You’re More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you’ll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It’s tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup—branding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you’re not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it’s worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always). 

Our strongsuite vs competitors is SEO, which is where we're doing a lot better than some, but they seem to be getting more traffic, revenue (1 competitor hit $1m ARR in 6 months using YouTube &amp; Google ads only) which is pretty mind boggling to me. 

So we're planning to run YT, Google ads and an extensive competitor research stint, that'll help us replicate this. 

Any who was in a similar situation have any advice on this?

1h6iy9o,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what AI can do for your business—if you start today.",2,startups,1733326668.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/

We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.

We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.

Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.

You can download your catalog as a pdf

My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.

1h5oz6l,The Product-Market-Fit confirmation I could only dream about,"Hey there! I'm solo building my SaaS for more than 2 years now, selling for 13 months already. I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster. 

But most importantly, I know have a strong feeling, I'm building something meaningful.

And I wish you all experience the same thing! (unless you already did ;)) 🚀",88,startups,1733237070.0,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5oz6l/the_productmarketfit_confirmation_i_could_only/
1h6cqec,Co-Founders or Investors for SMBs,"
I’m a software engineer based in Australia with startup experience—I ran a small company with 5 employees for 3 years and sold it 10 years ago.

I’ve built an AI app, available only on the App Store, for small businesses like plumbers and electricians. The app helps with:

Invoicing: For example, a plumber can say, “Just fixed John Doe's dishwasher, bill him $200,” and it generates the invoice.

Task management and client tracking

Ad campaigns: Users can ask the AI to set up a Facebook ad to find customers nearby.

Website updates: Easily update pricing or services with voice commands.

The app is live but still in early stages. Some people downloaded it, but no one has registered yet. I also need to add key features like ad campaign tools.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I look for co-founders with skills in online ads (like Google or Facebook Ads) or technical expertise to help grow it?

Or should I focus on finding investors so I can hire a dev team and salespeople?

What’s the smarter choice to grow from here? If co-founders are the answer, how do I find the right ones? If it’s investors, where do I start without a user base?

I’d really appreciate your advice. Thanks!

1h6cn1l,"36 startup ideas found by analyzing podcasts (problem, solution &amp; source episode)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains – this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

1h6ar6x,Startup Wisdom: Done is Better Than Perfect,"Hey there, startup enthusiasts and fellow entrepreneurs,

I’ve got some advice to share that’s been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? “Done is better than perfect.” Don’t get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100. Then, based on user feedback, you can decide whether to continue investing in improving the product or to pivot.

Another tip is to create a landing page as soon as possible to start engaging with your users. This helps you gather valuable insights and build a community around your product from the get-go.

If you’re in a situation where you don’t have the coding skills or aren’t sure how to create a landing page, check out my profile. Our team has developed an AI-powered low-code platform that can generate front-end pages through conversation.",3,startups,1733297927.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6ar6x/startup_wisdom_done_is_better_than_perfect/
1h5y72m,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?","So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

Any wise words from the community? Thank you",9,startups,1733260026.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5y72m/validation_by_preselling_before_building_how_to/

1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built? Do you have any advice for me?",62,startups,1733187116.0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5azfu/we_should_have_started_with_a_technical_cofounder/

1h5yefu,"Am I thinking correctly about how to develop an ideal client profile for a tool to help websites deal with bot traffic? 
","We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

Am I missing something here?

Am I thinking about it the right way?

What do you guys think?

1h5ycm3,P&amp;L Spending Analyzer,"**Pitch:**  
Stealth AI is your personal expense optimizer. It analyzes your P&amp;L, finds cheaper alternatives for every expense, rates the hassle of switching (A+ to F), and delivers monthly reports with actionable savings. It even scours the web and user reviews to ensure smarter spending decisions. Save money without the headaches—effortlessly.

# Why Now?

* **Economic Pressure**: Businesses are facing tighter margins and growing pressure to cut costs amidst economic uncertainty.
* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.
* **Demand for Efficiency**: Companies are increasingly seeking tools to streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize ROI.

# Competition

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don’t actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.
* **DIY Research**: Most businesses rely on manual comparisons and reviews, which is time-consuming and prone to missed opportunities.

**Edge of Stealth AI**: By combining automated expense analysis, real-time pricing from the web, and community insights (e.g., Reddit), Stealth AI creates a unique value proposition that is both cost-effective and proactive—an unmet need in the market.**""**",0,startups,1733260414.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5ycm3/pl_spending_analyzer/

I’m doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I’ve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners—things like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don’t fit founders’ needs.

1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *“Why not try making my own dream come true?”*. That’s when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *“You’re a lifesaver!”* That’s when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I’ve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It’s been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I’ve started working on another extension for Claude, which I’m hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

1h5vtd2,"Had my producthunt launch yesterday, low upvotes but lots of traffic, what's next?","Hey everyone, I had my product hunt launch yesterday, didn't market it at all and just wanted to see what kind of traffic/feedback I would get. Even though the upvotes were low at \~15, the amount of traffic was pretty decent spiking at 1,100 DAU which was amazing. This makes me think 2 things. Firstly, lots of people  were intrigued enough to try the app and didn't really like it so they didn't upvote. But secondly, the DAU dropped today to about 300 today after the launch with plenty of returning users, way more than actually upvoted, which means way more users got value then participated in upvoting on product hunt. 

My question is basically, whats next? My app is somewhat unique in that it requires no account for you to use the app, so I don't have a huge email list (even though I do plan on reaching out to users that actually logged in). The app relies on the user getting enough value out of the product to log in and save their work and also use advanced AI features. That means that I'm really looking to just get as much traffic as possible, hoping for conversions, and eventually monetizing the app? Outside of reaching out to current users for feedback, implementing it, and perhaps some actual marketing, are there any other viable strategies that I could use?

* male, 30 years old
* plays golf
* reads the financial times

I've often read and seen people using avatars for their marketing strategy. I undestand that bringing your target audience 'into live' is nice to get a better feeling of what they are like and ultimately how to get in touch with them. But from my understanding most of the characteristics is based on pure speculation and assumptions. Let's take my example with the 30 year old male. I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

1h54n5u,Need Advice: Working for a Startup with No Pay (yet) – Stocks vs. Profit Sharing?,"Hey everyone,

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There’s no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We’re not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here’s the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we’ve put into the company. Right now, he’s unable to pay more money because he’s fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states **""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""** which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I’m a software engineer—I can code fast and efficiently—but this feels like uncharted territory.

I’m currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I’m not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I’m skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes, **stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He’s also offered $500–$1000 a month, but I’d honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here’s my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I am currently a junior in college. I previously, in highschool and at the start of college, ran an Etsy 3D Printing store. I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea.

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I’m not sure if it’s something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

1h4ta7r,Please advise ,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the early stages of building an MVP for my startup, and could really use some advice and encouragement from this amazing community.

A bit about my startup: My company is focused on revolutionizing agricultural trade and beyond. Our vision is to empower smallholder farmers by connecting them with global buyers through a blockchain-integrated web portal.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.
It's been a challenge balancing the development costs while maintaining the momentum of the project.

What I'm looking for:

Advice on getting investors after completing the MVP: For those of you who've been here before, how did you approach investors at this stage? What worked for you?

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or even connect further if you're interested in this space.",1,startups,1733140492.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4ta7r/please_advise/

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting** after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.** Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation? How did you figure out if it was time to seek validation in more dynamic markets? I need to connect with those who've been through this.

I'm not looking for shortcuts or magic solutions. **Just the chance to test my product in a market where a ""yes"" means yes and a ""no"" means no.** And maybe some guidance from those who've already made this leap.",1,startups,1733129921.0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4qtp3/founder_caught_between_amazing_product_and_0/

Navigating the startup world can be overwhelming, especially when resources are scattered and hard to find. As a native Detroiter and lifelong Michigander, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to uncover statewide resources like co-working spaces, funding opportunities, accelerators, grants, and events. If you’re not from a specific region or deeply connected, these opportunities can feel hidden.

So, I decided to create a free, searchable directory of Michigan startup resources. It’s designed for entrepreneurs and founders to quickly filter resources by region and tags, making it easy to find exactly what you need—no endless Googling or outdated lists.

This started as a personal project to help me organize everything, but I realized how much value it could provide to others in the startup ecosystem. My goal is to keep it updated and add even more resources over time.

1h4daw1,Is a patent or IP necessary?,"Hi everyone, I’m building a startup in the healthcare field. I wrote the code during a research year in medical school. I wasn’t enrolled and the school has already said they won’t claim any ownership of the Intellectual Property. 

But a lot of my mentors, who are physicians so aren’t familiar with software startups, advised me to pursue a patent. I’ve heard that software is impossible to patent and usually a copyright is good enough. 

My school, while currently not claiming ownership of the software, says that they are happy to pay the ~$30,000 required to file the patent/IP paperwork as long as I give them full rights to it. 

I don’t want to do that, especially since I have other investors who are happy to cover those costs while only wanting some equity in the company. 

My question is do I really need to file for an IP? If not, what would prevent another company from coming in and doing the same thing I’m trying to do? Other than not having the credibility among the customer base or other external factors like that.

1h488p4,Carta Pricing,"I recently looked into Carta's discounts for early-stage tech startups and thought I'd share what I found, in case it's useful to others. If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don’t meet those criteria, you’ll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven’t already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free—Stripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

1h49urb,What’s your top priority for onboarding right after launching a customer-facing service?  ,"Onboarding is the backbone of any customer-facing service.  
No matter how amazing your product is, if users don’t understand it or it takes too long to get started, it’ll quickly become a service no one uses.  

Plus, being too hesitant to show a paywall can hold back revenue, and a trial period that’s too short might stop users from even giving it a chance.

- Early on, improving onboarding beats developing new features.  
- Letting users start without an account boosted tutorial completion rates by 10%.  
- Don’t fear the paywall—it’s there for a reason.  
- Nobody reads long explanations—let them dive into the experience instead.  
- Open-ended freedom doesn’t work—guide users with a clear first step.

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

1h3lod0,How do I get first users to sign up?,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

Thanks a lot for reading everything, all the feedbacks are appreciated!",5,startups,1732998831.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h3lod0/how_do_i_get_first_users_to_sign_up/

After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here’s the truth: sales isn’t about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I’ve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50–100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer’s pain points.
4. **Don’t Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return—like a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you’re not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you’re flying blind.

1hcg7nz,Startup Culture,"- Great businesses are all about a great idea.
- Ideas are nothing; it’s all execution. &lt;— we are here.
-  Execution is nothing; it’s resilience.
- Resilience is nothing; it’s timing.
- It’s all just luck.

This pretty much sums up how I feel about startup culture. 

First it was all about the idea, people are obsessed with coming up with the next big thing. Then about execution, and we get bombarded with hustle culture… But then even great execution doesn’t guarantee success. That’s where resilience comes in - sticking with it, pivoting when necessary, and refusing to give up. Except resilience means nothing if you launch a great product at the wrong time.

But then there’s luck. The thing no one wants to admit is that luck.. being in the right place at the right time, connected or rich parents, born in the right location or right time, meeting the right person, or stumbling into the perfect market etc… often plays the biggest role.

It has about 400 downloads, most of which are friends and family + some people from reddit.

I assume I probably won't ever make much money off this app, but I have seen the main Vocabulary app on the App Store have millions of downloads + saw on SensorTower that it generates about $200k per month in revenue. I actually began using this app when I was looking for what my app offers, but honestly was not impressed with the feature offerings.

I'm assuming they probably have pretty high cost on marketing because I see them all over instagram and they come up as the first ad on the app store. Anyways, that makes me think that there is at least decent interest in the ""vocabulary building"" space and a potential to generate some revenue.

This is also my first project and I spent a lot of time on it, so I'm willing to go a few grand in the hole to see if I can get a lot of downloads. If I do, then maybe I could throw some ads on the app or introduce a premium version and paywall some of the features. Idk.

Anyways, would love to get advice on which direction to go.

This is what I'm deciding between:

1. Instagram ads - tooting my own horn here but I think the app has a pretty solid looking UI, so I think the visual nature of instagram lends itself pretty well. Also instagram ads in general seem to be very effective (at least in my personal experience)
2. App store optimization - when I was looking for an app like this I just went to the app store and looked up vocabulary, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Maybe there are other people doing the same thing?
3. Reaching out to vocabulary / dictionary / productivity influencers

I would prefer to only do one of these options and commit 1-2k over the course of a few months. But again I am a total noob to this so if anyone has insight would love to hear it.",2,startups,1734022735.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcpl40/ready_to_run_an_ad_campaign_for_my_vocabulary_app/

1hcp20z,How Do I Gather My First Users for My Deals/Discounts Website?,"Hi everyone,

I launched my website about a month ago—a platform similar to HotUKDeals where users can find deals/discounts and upload their own deals to earn a 25% commission on each sale.

After the launch, I started promoting on social media (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and slowly started building followers (Insta: 55, Facebook: 13, TikTok: 23). Through Google Analytics, I can see some traction—about 300 new visitors weekly—but apart from family, nobody has purchased anything via affiliate links.

I’m passionate about the concept and still believe in its potential. However, I’m struggling to build a critical mass of users. I know that to create a successful platform, I need more users to upload deals, which will lead to more sales, more profit, and, ideally, a positive growth loop.

So far, I’ve tried:
	•	Posting regularly on social media.
	•	Following and engaging with people active on similar platforms.

But growth feels slow, and I’m looking for actionable advice to:
	1.	Drive more traffic to the website.
	2.	Encourage people to upload their own deals.
	3.	Build trust and encourage users to make purchases.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear what worked for you. I’m open to any tips, including unconventional ideas or strategies that might not be immediately obvious.

Happy to share more details about my platform, social media strategy, or analytics if that helps!

|VC|Comments|Overall Score|
|:-|:-|:-|
|fika|Easy to connect and schedule, spoke to an associate who was respectful and intelligent. Did a quick follow up with one of the key partners. The partner meeting looked a bit disengaged and barely asked questions. It seemed he didnt want to be there :) The associate promptly responded in a few days with a respectful reject email citing reasons that seemed genuine. Overall, would still recommend working with them based on the interaction.|8/10|
|Firebolt|The founding partner himself tracked down the startup from a ""VC dark network"". He was persistent. Had 1 call with 2 of the founding partners. They were fully engaged. However, 1 partner who initially reached out seemed to have lost interest half way and started asking annoying questions. Never heard back from them after that 1 call. Total ghosting :)|5/10|
|NextView Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. However, they rescheduled it on the day off the call. When we actually met, the partner disclaimed that they know very little about my space. They asked high level questions. Mid-way through their child walked into the meeting :) I honestly didn't mind it. Kids will be kids! But then the kid got on the nerves of the partner who lashed out their kid right in front of me. Ouch :( The partner was totally distracted from that point on. After a few days they got back promptly citing a legitimate sounding reason.|6/10|
|Ridge Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. The partner was respectful and genuinely interested in learning about the startup. At the same time earnestly raised concerns about my market and it's ability to create winners. They followed up with an investment committe meeting. The meeting invite was awesome. It had the names of the attendees and their backgrounds in good detail so it saved me a ton of time researching each one of them. During the call, all of them were leaning in and genuinely interested in learning about the opportunity. They also challenged certain aspects but did it respectfully. Finally, they promptly followed up but without giving a reason. I requested to give some feedback and the partner setup a call! However, they did a no show on the call :)|9/10|
|SignalFire|They reached out by finding about the startup from the ""VC dark network"". The main contact was very excited after the first call. He followed up with a few questions and then setup a quick follow up with a couple other people. On the second call, the founding partner was suave and respectful. Although he didn't lean in much. A principal was hyper enthusiastic trying to impress his partners by asking awkwardly challenging questions. The main contact responded promptly with a reject and citing specific reasosn which was much appreciated.|9/10|
|Vertex|Call was scheduled promptly through a strong connection. Two partners showed up and both were great to interact with. They were genuinely trying to understand the business and evaluate the opportunity. Through the call it started to emerge that they didn't see it. But despite that they were respectful, cited their initial concerns. They did say that they will get back shortly with a more thoughtful reason. But they ghosted :) At least they were nice on the call!|7/10|
|Weekend Fund|Call was scheduled promptly. The partner was not familiar with the space but leaned in with decent questions. They said they would follow up. There was silence for several days but eventually got back. They claim to be pre-seed but they said they need more traction.|7/10|
|Zero Prime|The junior partner found the deal through the ""VC dark network"". Persisted and eventually we met. He was very enthusiastic and said will quickly follow up with a partner meeting. But then ghosted. No news ever again!|4/10|
|A16Z|Connected to a partner who was from my alma mater. First call was scheduled promptly. They were genuinely interested and asked good questions. They liked the space and the problem being addressed. They promised to follow up shortly. They did follow up citing genuine reasons.|8/10|
|HustleFund|Very frustrating and unclear process. They make you fill out a TypeForm form. Its quite an unwieldy way to fill out long pieces of text. It doesn't save your responses etc. Once I submitted they just sent a reject email in less than 24 hours :D What a fricking waste of time. They logged into the deck but didn't look beyond the title slide. So they didn't really evaluate it. Stay away!|2/10|
|Canaan|Scheduled promptly. Through the meeting didn't really engage and show genuine interest in learning about the statup. They were upfront that they do only companies with traction. So they should have not really even taken the meeting. They said they would get back shortly. But ghosted!!|4/10|
|Unusual Ventures|They were definitely on the bottom of my list. After submitting an online form they very eagerly and promptly setup a meeting based on the teams profiles. During the meeting, they were waiting for one of their main partners who joined late. That partner came totally unprepared and started off with a very condescending tone right of the bat. They were combative right from the beginning and just wanted to play Shark Tank - it seemed like it was entertainment for this partner. I told him that I have already heard that you didn't like this deal and hinted that we don't need to talk any further. Through the back channel later heard that that partner is quite toxic. Stay away!|1/10|
|Boldstart Ventures|Approached them through a warm contact. They didn't take a meeting citing their genuine position on my market - they don't invest in my market. Respect to them for saving everyone's time.|7/10|
|Costanoa|Another one towards the bottom of my list. It was easy to get in touch through a warm intro and the call was scheduled promptly. Two people joined - one was a partner, it wasn't clear what the other person was. This other person was a new member on the firm. They started of asking questions to stump you. There was barely any indication of a genuine effort in understanding the business. The body language was very poor. It felt condescending. They said they would get back in 2 to 4 weeks, but they never got back.|3/10|
|Felicis|The partner scheduled time promptly, asked insighftul questions, gave clarity on next steps. After a few days responded with a thoughtful email citing their reasons. Well done! High points for overall professional engagement.|9/10|
|Array VC|This one was also on the bottom of my list. The partner does not reply to emails promptly. And when they replied they were short half sentence emails - lack of genuine interest/professionalism. They claim they are focused on data &amp; analytics. So I thought they would be genuinely interested. But they didn't go beyond email interactions.|2/10|
|Wing Venture Capital|They comfortably found the link to my deck through the ""VC dark network"", went through it without permission, probably didn't like the deal and never even contacted me. It felt very disrespectful that they just went to the deck though they were not explicitly given access to it. Shady!!|2/10|
|Wave Capital|Conneced through a friend, very nice guy. Thoughtful and attentive. Not a market fit as they are into marketplaces. But still offered to connect to their network.|8/10|
|Afore Capital|In the bottom half of my list. I connected with a partner through a warm connection. But without even responding to me an associate took over. The associate set up a 20 minute meeting!! And for that they showed up 10 minutes late. So after a 15 min evaluation from a recent grad my startup got rejected. Wow! I am sure they spoilt with good deals.|3/10|
|GGV (Notable)|They took the meeting promptly. However, there was not much interest in engaging when they were on the call. They said they would get back, but they never did. Why do their waste their own time (and mine!)|4/10|
|Battery Ventures|They were eager to meet. However, after presenting to them and an engaging discussion, they said they only do series A or later :D Then why did you bother meeting and waste my time :D|6/10|
|Lerer Hippeau|Connected through a friend and was promptly scheduled for a meeting with an associate. The associate was very nice and engaged with inquisitive questions. He set up a follow on with one of the main partners. The main partner, however, was not very engaged he had made up his mind a few minutes into the call that this is not a deal he likes, which is fine. He said he'll get back with some feedback. Couple of days later they got back with some feedback.|8/10|
|Emergent VC|Got connected to them through a friend. The partner requested for updates over email. Sent them all the updates but the partner never even replied to the email. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Ovo Ventures|Easy to schedule with them, met them through a warm connection. The partner met and asked great questions and it was a good lively discussion. They did make it clear what the concerns were during the meeting. And then very promptly followed back, citing their reasons honestly. Very respecttful &amp; professional!|9/10|
|Kearney Jackson|Met them through a warm connection and the meeting was set up pretty quickly. Both the partners showed up and engaged very actively asked great questions. It felt like I learned something. They got back promptly, giving genuine reasons. Very professional great performance would work with them .|9/10|
|Nexus|Met them through a warm connection and a meeting was set up promptly. The partner was very curious and fully engaged. The meeting was in person. After going through the business, he was upfront that he didn't see a good market opportunity. But was classy in the way he said that. He did say he would follow up, but he never did.|7/10|
|Lightspeed Venture Partners|This was again through a warm connection and the meeting was set up promptly. The partner was engaged, although it wasn't clear how much he really understood. He did ask for some time to evaluate the business. He got back after a few days in a professional manner. No real complaints but wasn't impressive.|7/10|
|Montavista|I sent an email directly to the main partner who is from the same alma matter as me. They responded quickly and scheduled  time for an in person meeting along with the partnership. Everybody showed up on time. They had six people on the call. Three in the room with me and three on a Zoom call. Couple of them has great genuine questions and wanted to understand the opportunity. However, one person was very annoying, trying to put me down several times. It seemed they were trying to justify their value to the partnership by saying things like ""I can connect you with this big guy or that big guy"". The main partner, however, was awesome. He got back promptly citing his reasons for rejection.|7/10|
|Altos Ventures|Met the partner through a warm referral. They suggested an in person meeting. However, they don't have any parking around there which made it stressful. Also, it was far away from where I live so it was too much time commitment. And what made it more annoying was that within the first two minutes we established that they don't do preseed and seed stage investments. I wish they had just done a zoom call before an in-person. To their credit the partner was very nice and we had a good debate around the pros and cons of my startup strategy.|6/10|
|ENIAC VC|Got an intro into the firm from a warm referral. However, the email responses were very slow and when they did respond, the scheduler did not set up a meeting. I had to send a reminder to get the meeting scheduled. The partner who I met with did not really lean in. They said they would get back with next steps, but never did. Ghosted!|4/10|
|Foundation Capital|Got connected to them through a warm referral. In fact, foundation wanted to meet with me. However, when we connected they scheduled a meeting three weeks out! And on the day of the meeting, they rescheduled it. And then on the day of the meeting, the partner said that they would be taking the call on voice while driving. The audio was terrible. During the meeting, the partner was condescending. The saving grace was that the partner was smart and direct which I totally appreciate. But they were disrespectful which I totally don't appreciate.|4/10|
|Peak XV|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled two weeks out! When we met, one partner was still driving to work and the other partner was running behind. They did engage actively and showed genuine interest in the problem space. They said they would evaluate the market and get back for next steps. But I never heard back. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Village Global|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled promptly. I had to reschedule the first meeting because of an emergency. But the partner was very respectful and promptly accepted the reschedule. When we met, we established that they are from my industry. That really made the conversation engaging and meaningful. They got the idea! They followed back with very good questions. They also set clear expectations about the timeline for a decision.|8/10|
|Swift Ventures|They reached out to me by finding about me through the ""VC dark network"". The meeting was set up promptly, and one of the main partners attended. The discussion was decent. The partner was humble. But knew very little about my space. I thought it was a no-go I did not bother to follow up. But they followed up a few days later asking for my deck to have a clear closure. I sent the deck and a few hours later they got back stating their reasons for not going through.

1hci1oy,Freelance/Task Platform MVP Without an Escrow System?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice from entrepreneurs, developers, and experts who’ve worked on building platforms or MVPs.

I’m based in Ethiopia, where platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit have a huge untapped market but also face unique barriers. My goal is to create a platform tailored to my country, solving challenges like:

Payment Systems: Most Ethiopians don’t have access to international payment platforms like PayPal.

Language Barrier: Many don’t speak fluent English to navigate these global platforms.

Task Complexity: Many tasks on these platforms require high-level skills. I want to focus on simple, delegatable tasks, both digital and physical.


My Plan

I’m starting small with an MVP to validate the idea. Initially, I planned to use a Telegram bot interlinked with channels to mimic the platform experience. The idea was:

Users could find and post tasks for free (no commissions).

The bot would handle task assignments and communication.

Tasks would be split into digital (simple remote tasks like trimming videos or translating text) and physical (local jobs like delivering items or assembling furniture).


However, I hit a major roadblock:
I need an escrow system to build trust between users. But to integrate with Ethiopia’s banking system, I’d need:

A registered business

A trade license

A physical office, etc.


This requires upfront money (~$2000), which I don’t have.

My Question

How can I build an MVP that attracts users without an escrow system?

Are there ways to create trust and security without formal escrow?

Can I simplify the platform further to avoid needing banking integration?

Should I pivot to a different MVP idea that requires fewer resources?


I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. If anyone has tackled similar challenges, your advice would be invaluable.

1hbxxpd,How I run customer interviews (and why they're better than analytics for 0-1),"## Why talk to customers?

Look, I've built products at companies of all sizes - tiny startups, growing scale-ups, and 500-person enterprises. The one thing that's always worked? Actually talking to customers. Especially when you're starting from scratch.

Don't get me wrong - tools like Amplitude are great at showing you what people do in your app. But they miss everything that happens outside it. Some of the best insights I've found came from discovering that people were using weird Excel templates or Word docs as workarounds. You'd never catch that in your analytics.

## Getting good at interviews isn't hard

A lot of people get nervous about customer interviews. I get it - talking to strangers can be awkward. But honestly? It comes down to a few simple techniques that anyone can learn. Here's what works for me when I'm trying to understand customer problems.

## The techniques that actually work

### Ask questions that let people ramble

The best insights come when you let people tell their stories. Instead of asking ""Do you use Excel for this?"" (which just gets you a yes/no), ask ""How do you handle this today?"" Then shut up and listen.

### Repeat stuff back to them

This one's surprisingly powerful. When someone spends five minutes explaining their process, just summarize it back: ""So what you're saying is...?""

Two things happen:
1. If you misunderstood something (which happens all the time), they'll correct you
2. They often remember important details they forgot to mention

### Go down rabbit holes

Some of the best stuff comes from completely random tangents. When someone mentions something interesting, keep pulling that thread. Keep asking why. I've had calls where we went totally off-topic and found way bigger problems than what we originally wanted to talk about.

## How to run the actual call

### First five minutes

I always start the same way:

""Hey, thanks for jumping on. We've got 30 minutes - that still work for you? Cool. I wanted to talk about [topic]. You might have other stuff you want to ask about, but let's save that for the end if we have time. That sound okay?""

Simple, but it:
- Makes sure they're not running off to another meeting in 10 minutes
- Keeps things focused
- Lets them know they'll get to ask their questions too

### Diving into the conversation

Here's the thing about good interviews - they should feel like natural conversations, not interrogations. Start as wide as possible. I usually kick off with something super open-ended like ""Tell me about how you handle [whatever process] today.""

Then just listen. Like, really listen. When they mention something interesting, that's your cue to dig deeper. Say they mention ""Yeah, it's frustrating because I have to copy stuff between systems."" Don't just note that down and move on. That's gold! Follow up with ""Tell me more about that. What are you copying? Where from? Where to?""

The best stuff often comes from these diving-deeper moments. Maybe you'll discover they spend two hours every Friday copying data from their ticketing system into Excel because the reporting sucks. That's the kind of insight you can actually do something with.

Sometimes the conversation will hit a natural lull. That's when you pull from your question bank. But don't rush to fill every silence. Some of the best insights come right after those slightly awkward pauses when people remember ""Oh yeah, and there's this other thing that drives me crazy...""

### Questions I keep handy

Instead of a strict script, I keep a list of reliable questions I can throw in when needed:

- ""How do you deal with this right now?""
- ""On a scale of 1-10, how annoying is this problem?""
- ""What's an even bigger pain in your day?""
- ""Tell me about the last time this came up""
- ""Do you use any other tools for this? Excel? Word?""
- ""If you could wave a magic wand, how would this work?""

Don't treat these like a checklist. They're just there for when the conversation hits a wall or you need to dig deeper into something interesting.

### How to keep it flowing

1. Start really broad. Let them talk about their day, their problems, whatever's on their mind.

2. When they mention something painful, dig into it.

3. Sometimes asking about the same thing different ways helps. People might not realize they're using a workaround until you specifically mention spreadsheets or sticky notes.

4. Save the ""magic wand"" question for last. By then they've thought through all their problems and can better imagine solutions.

## Stuff that kills good interviews

1. **Asking leading questions**: Don't say ""Wouldn't it be better if..."" Just ask ""How would you improve this?""

2. **Trying to sell**: You're there to learn, not pitch. Save the product talk.

3. **Sticking too hard to your questions**: If they start talking about something interesting, follow that instead.

4. **Not recording**: Always ask if you can record. You'll miss stuff in your notes, and sometimes you need to hear exactly how they said something.

## Why this matters

Here's the thing: Analytics can tell you what users do, but only interviews tell you why. The best products I've worked on started with stuff I never would have found in analytics. They came from actual conversations where I shut up and let people tell me about their weird workarounds and daily frustrations.

Sure, it takes time. Yes, it can be awkward. But it works better than anything else I've tried.",41,startups,1733935901.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbxxpd/how_i_run_customer_interviews_and_why_theyre/

1hcfpwh,Turning a Dream into Reality: Seeking Support to Empower Thousands in Ethiopia,"Hi everyone,

I’m a dreamer from Ethiopia, a country where opportunities are hard to come by, but dreams still thrive. I’m working on building something that could change lives—not just mine, but countless others in my community. It’s a platform that seamlessly connects task creators with task doers. Imagine waking up stressed about money, without a job, or being a student needing quick income. My platform would let anyone with a laptop or phone find simple, quick tasks they can complete remotely—whether it’s a 2-hour gig or a one-day job. No hassle, no stress, just a way to make legitimate money right from your bed.

This isn’t just a website to me; it’s my passion and my purpose. I want to create a credible, seamless, and addictive platform that gives people a chance to thrive. For many here, $2,000 might not seem like much, but in Ethiopia, it’s a fortune. It’s the one barrier stopping me from making this vision a reality.

Sadly, platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter don’t work in my region, and finding funding locally is almost impossible. So, I’m reaching out directly to anyone out there who believes in the power of ideas and the impact one person can make. I know this idea has the potential to transform lives, to take people from feeling stuck to feeling empowered.

If you’ve ever had a dream you believed in with your whole heart but just didn’t have the resources to bring it to life, you know how I feel. I need $2,000 to get started, and I promise this isn’t just about me. It’s about building a system that helps people in my country find dignity, opportunity, and hope in the simplest way.

If you can support me or even share this message, you’re not just helping me; you’re becoming part of a journey to create something bigger than both of us. One person’s trash is another person’s gold, and this dream is my gold.

Thank you for reading and for believing in someone you’ve never met. Sometimes, all it takes is one act of kindness to change a life—and maybe many lives.",0,startups,1733987830.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcfpwh/turning_a_dream_into_reality_seeking_support_to/

I’m an entrepreneur from Ethiopia, a country where opportunities are limited, and creating luck often feels like an uphill battle. But I believe that luck isn’t impossible—it just takes time and the right mindset. Right now, I’m working on something that I truly believe can transform lives here: a platform that connects task creators with task doers, allowing anyone to earn money quickly and easily, even from the comfort of their home.

My vision goes beyond just making money—I want to empower people, especially those who feel stuck or hopeless. This is a passion project, and I’m determined to make it a reality. But to do so, I need support. I’m looking for $2,000 in funding to get this project off the ground and make it legal in Ethiopia.

I’m also searching for like-minded tech co-founders who share a bigger vision for life, who dream of impacting millions or even billions, rather than being content with just material wealth. Unfortunately, finding people like that here is incredibly difficult. The entrepreneurial mindset in my country often feels limited to short-term gains, while my dream is to create something lasting and impactful.

If you’ve faced similar struggles or have any advice, guidance, or resources that can help, I would be so grateful. And if anyone is willing to invest or collaborate, it could truly change not only my life but the lives of countless others here.

The number of shares will be pegged at the valuation of the next funding round, which is set to occur fairly soon.

1hc01id,Product and Message Differentiation is everything. Here's how I find both ,"**Introduction:** 

Great messaging is essential. Your message is the first thing anyone hears, reads, or sees about your business. It’s your elevator pitch, business card, tagline, and more all rolled into one.

Differentiated messaging — the only kind that really matters — is even more important. It not only conveys who you are, but who your target customers are and how you help them in a way your competitors can’t.

If done well, differentiated messaging helps every part of your organization level up:

* **Marketing** understands *who* you want to reach and *how* your company alone can help them. The team writes better copy, creates more effective campaigns, and builds an inbound machine filled with great prospects.
* **Sales** understands marketing’s *who* and *how*, but is also armed with a cheat code that helps them thrive in any competitive conversation they encounter.
* **Product** gets a clearer understanding of your advantage in the eyes of your customers (as opposed to their minds) and doubles down on what buyers care about most and can make smart investment and roadmap decisions.

Without a solid differentiated foundation, you and your teams suffer from:

* **Confusion**: What exactly does your company offer that’s special and why do customers care?
* **Low-confidence:** How do we talk about our product and business? Are these campaigns and talk tracks likely to work? What do we build? Who do we pursue?
* **Second-guessing and bad suggestions:** Without doing the hard work of figuring out how you're unique and valuable (i.e. differentiated), every mediocre idea gets considered, every good idea is prone to second-guessing. You waste time, energy, and enthusiasm.

You need to do the work to set a foundation and execute.

The good news: None of the above is that difficult to overcome. With a little knowledge of your competitors, product, and customers, you can create great differentiated messaging. 

All it takes is the right framework and some time.

**A few useful definitions:** 

* **Differentiator:**A characteristic of your firm that separates you from key competitors and gives you a perceived advantage in the eyes of your target customers
   * Key Elements: 
      * Entire firm, not just the product
      * Key competitors, not every competitor
      * Customer focus  
* **Messaging:**The key concepts you want a prospect to know about your company. What do you provide? How do you provide it? What value do customers receive? Messaging is the foundation that supports effective marketing, copywriting, campaigns, sales conversations, and more.  
* **Differentiated Messaging:**This is the unique message and story that only you can tell because of the product and company you’ve built and customers you serve. It tells prospects how you’re uniquely valuable to them and how you alone can help achieve a particular outcome. Differentiated messaging should be your marketing team’s holy grail and first priority before writing a website, one-pager, case study, or any other piece of collateral.

**Step 1: Get Smart**

You’re going to have a very hard time telling a compelling story about your business if you don’t understand your product, customers, and competitors, which are the Core Components of Differentiated Messaging.Founders *sometimes* know their product, customers, and competitors well enough to proceed straight to Step 2, but there are plenty of founders who have understandably confused themselves about who they serve well and why. They’re too in the weeds to be effective marketers. 

Other leaders — CMOs, sales and product leaders, and product marketers — will need to partner across teams to make sure they’ve got the requisite knowledge to have a fruitful discussion.The idea is to know each of the Core Components as a team. A single individual doesn’t need all of this knowledge, but across a team, you need to know product, customers, and competitors. 

In general you should know (or get to know) your:

* Customers: 
   * Firmographics: What types of businesses have you sold to in the past? Consider industry, team size and composition, revenue, geography, tech stack, and customer base. This will help you develop a hypothesis about which potential segments you serve best.
   * Buyers: Who within a firm do you sell to most often? What persona? Who else is in the buyer map?
   * Problems: What problems are the companies you serve facing? What are they trying to accomplish?
   * Why you: The most difficult question to answer accurately is why customers chose you. Your sales conversations should give you an idea about why a customer chose you, but you may need to circle back and ask again. A decent win-loss program really helps here.

* Product: 
   * Features: You may have a technical product with a long list of features. It’s possible that 1-2 of these are a key differentiator.
   * Non-Product Attributes: While we tend to focus on features in technology, it’s likely that your customers value some other aspect of your firm. The sales experience, delivery channel, customer service, industry expertise, and more are all possible differentiation factors. So while the product gets the most attention, be sure to think beyond the software.  
* Competitors: 
   * It’s easy to go too deep on your competitors. You can easily consider too many competitors and think too much about their features, customers, investors, marketing and more. Instead, focus on the three competitors you see most often in deals, and focus on their marketing. Limit your research here competitors’ websites and five most recent blog posts and press releases. You’ll need to consume this marketing with a critical eye. Look for what they’re saying and *what they’re not saying*.

**Step 2: Structured Workshop With Your Team**

This is the crux.

Of the three steps, this workshop is the one that has the biggest potential impact. If done well you’ll surface useful disagreements, compelling insights, unique perspectives, and come to consensus on what matters most. It uncovers facts, drives alignment, and helps win buy-in, all of which are keys to a successful messaging project.

I use a framework called MUD, which I learned from a very smart colleague. MUD is an acronym for:

* Meaningful: Can we charge money for this attribute?
* Unique: Do we alone offer it? Can our target customers get the same thing elsewhere?
* Defensible: Can we prove what we claim with data or testimonials?

Here’s the workshop process:

1. **Discuss potential differentiators as a group**This isn’t quite a brainstorm, but it is a broad discussion about your business and customers. You want to encourage people to consider the business broadly and think beyond mere product features — remember the elements of a differentiator in the definition above.You’ll notice the same ideas surfacing again and again from slightly different angles, with slightly different emphases. That’s great! Let the ideas and opinions flow during this portion of the discussion. That said, it’s helpful if you can combine similar ideas to points that have already been made, as it makes subsequent steps easier. An experienced facilitator can really help here.Depending on your product and market, you should generate a list of 10-30 potential differentiators.  
2. **Evaluate based on MUD**With a list of 20-30 potential differentiators in hand, you then evaluate them based on the MUD framework.Go down your list and ask yourselves if each is Meaningful (will someone pay for this attribute), Unique (you alone offer it), and Defensible (can you prove it). Be very honest. The temptation to fudge is strong, especially when you’re discussing Uniqueness, but being soft here will hurt in the long run. Again, an experienced facilitator can help you navigate tough questions and commit to ideas with promise.The MUD process should hone your imprecise list of 20-30 potential differentiators down to 3-5 well-articulated, high-quality attributes that you can share confidently with your team, prospects, and customers.

**Step 3: Refine results to craft a compelling story**

A workshop alone won’t lead to clear and compelling differentiators. You’ll need a team of articulate colleagues to make your differentiators shine and to highlight the value that each delivers. Spend time with a colleague or two to refine what you created in the workshop and highlight the value each delivers for your target customers.You should seek to use each of your differentiators as a pillar that supports a compelling story about your customer, product, and market. And that story should lead customers directly to one solution … yours.

1hbsxn7,Are you pivoting after a negative pitch?,"Hi all,

so my co founder and me (I am the IT guy) just had our first real pitch to a potential pilot customer. We are working on a platform where users are able to buy services. The niche is not very digital yet. 
So we presented our idea and he said that it will not work because they will always use the payment and redemption options in their existing POS provider. They are also working on some local apps to have it more digital and don't need an overall platform, because we will not be able to onboard all other businesses. 
So we are asking ourselves now if we need to pivot on some main features or not. Our app will be much better for the enduser, but if we don't have businesses on our platform it will not help. An integration to the POS systems would be great, but to expensive at the beginning. We wanted to handle the payments here and redeem the products via QR Codes in the beginning. I still think we have a great solution, but he said we should change the area for our business.

So are you pivoting some features after every feedback or do you evaluate the feedback and then continue working on the general product?

1hbrl60,3 Key Elements of a High-Converting Web App MVP 🚀,"As someone who builds MVPs as a part of my daily job, I’ve learned a lot about what works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to creating impactful web applications. Here are three things I always keep in mind:

1️⃣ **Simplicity is Key:** Your MVP isn’t meant to be feature-packed. Focus on the **core problem** you’re solving and implement just enough functionality to validate your idea. Adding too many features early can overwhelm users and delay launch.

2️⃣ **User Feedback Drives Growth:** The first version isn’t perfect—and it shouldn’t be. Launch early, then use **real feedback from users** to guide the next steps. Tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics can help you understand user behavior.

3️⃣ **Landing Pages Matter:** Your app is only half the battle. A clear, well-designed landing page with strong CTAs can significantly improve conversions. Highlight the benefits over features, and keep the design clean to avoid cognitive overload. A Good looking landing page &amp; a high conversion landing page are two diff things.

1hbz0xm,Worth Building this SAAS?,"I'm working on a SAAS which takes your content and localizes it, this includes translation with lipsyncing, using your own voice for dubbing etc.. as well as channel creation and automatic uploading. So you can link your youtube channel, select ""Spanish"" and the channel will be created and automatically go through the localization and uploading process every time you upload to your main channel, hence expanding your viewership/brand/revenue.

This will be available for Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter etc..

The main pushback against this is product is that Youtube is starting to add an ""Audio Track"" setting that enables automatic dubbing for your channel. The problem with relying solely on this Youtube feature for localization is that

1. It's being rolled out slowly and only available for a small amount of creators.
2. Even when dubbing is added it's unnatural because of the unsynced lips
3. Dubbing takes away the personal connection you create with your actual voice/brand recognition and uses a generic sound that is probably assigned to every other channel.
4. This may be incorrect but I've read that mixing your channel demographics from different countries can lower the ad rates for US based channels which have the highest rate. So if users start watching dubbed spanish and your main user base starts to shift from the US to say Brazil, then the revenue you generate will start decreasing opposed to keeping a purely US based rate.
5. While other platforms may start to push out dubbing sometime soon, right now only Youtube has just started to do it and trying to implement the other features such as using your own voice for dubbing at the scale Youtube has to deal with will be nearly impossible for a long time.

1hbkqyi,Llama is better? My client insists on Claude for building an AI Agent,"I’m working on a project where I need to build an AI agent for a client. As someone who has evaluated different models, I genuinely believe LLaMA (especially its recent iterations) is better for the job. Here’s why:
	1.	Customization: LLaMA is open-weight, which means I have far greater flexibility to fine-tune and tailor it for the specific use case. This level of control is perfect for creating a specialized agent.
	2.	Cost-Efficiency: Hosting LLaMA locally or on dedicated infrastructure can save significantly in the long term compared to relying on Claude’s API pricing structure.
	3.	Performance: Depending on the task, LLaMA has shown better accuracy and reasoning capabilities in many benchmarks. It also has a more robust architecture for handling nuanced instructions when properly fine-tuned.
	4.	Privacy: Since LLaMA can run on custom infrastructure, I can ensure data security and privacy, which is a big concern for many businesses these days.

However, my client is adamant about using Claude. I get it—it’s user-friendly, has a solid API, and works great out of the box for many general-purpose applications. But I feel like Claude’s closed ecosystem and less customizable nature might limit the long-term potential of the AI agent we’re building.

Am I wrong for pushing back on this? Has anyone else faced a similar situation where the client insists on a tool that you know isn’t the best fit? Would love to hear your thoughts on navigating this!

1hbbna8,Marketing organically is insanely hard and burning me out,"UK-based

I have a tech background and have blasted through building an MVP/prototype that shows off my idea concept, it took about 5 weeks. I'm trying to build interest and 75% of the time people respond positively (if they reply),  A handful of people have reached out asking to try it free of charge and but I haven't received any feedback yet. I have been reaching out to people via LinkedIn private messaging and reddit forums.

My idea is healthcare-related and I get the impression that many people in the industry are just overworked and don't have time nor motivation to try out my solution. They need an incentive, I am basically saying ""*hey, I made a thing, please can you try it for me AND let me know what you think for free???*"", it is a shock to me that people are even saying yes to this.

I don't know how to give that incentive to them without scaling the product, but then it would be foolish to scale a product that hasn't been validated, no?

I am currently unemployed and working on this full time and the lack of traction I am getting from marketing has been way more frustrating than I expected - when I was building I felt total control over how fast the project was moving and more alive than ever. Now I feel like I am frozen, and I am beating myself up over what feels like a huge lack of progress.

I would love some guidance, are there any angles I can take here? I have budget for advertising, I was thinking that I could create a landing page to gauge interest and then email the people who sign up personally instead of hoping they'll get back to me. Or should I scale out the product and build something that people want to use right now?

I recently had a really bad experience hiring a freelancer there, and I’m wondering if this is a common problem. It feels like the quality of work has gone downhill.

I needed a website for a travel-related project, so I hired someone who seemed qualified based on their profile. They said “yes” to the job right away, which seemed promising, but it all went downhill from there. Over the next seven days, they didn’t ask me a single question about the project or what I wanted. They didn’t clarify any details, offer suggestions, or check in at any point.

Then, right before the deadline, they submitted the final website. Unfortunately, it was a mess. It clearly didn’t meet the requirements, and it was obvious they hadn’t put much effort into understanding what I needed.

Thank you very much.

1hbux45,I’ve built an AI website builder and it’s free to use,"
So, at the start of this year, I had the idea to develop a free website builder for small business owners using Al, saving them months of stress and thousands in design costs.

Brands such as Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace are great, but they still required a certain level of skill to use and also took a decent amount of time to complete a website. We realised most business owners don't have this time and definitely didn't want to spend thousands on a new website. 

Our mission was to put an end on this completely.

So, we developed an AI website builder which we believe is the best in the market (after testing and paying attention to others)

Here’s how the platform works:
- AI does the heavy lifting: use it to design unlimited amounts of websites in seconds, or choose from 200+ professionally designed templates. 
- Not confident with tech? No worries, you can schedule a free 1-on-1 website setup call where we’ll design the website for you. (Basically, you’re getting a free web designer- no stress or hidden fees)
- Plus, our websites are easy to manage, you can do any updates yourself, anytime, without paying a penny more. And we have an online course with answers to all topics. 

This AI website builder has been developed all year and we’re now wanting more people to test it out for themselves, and to also gauge the interest from people - although we did reach 6K followers from pre launch ads! (Humble brag)

Right now, we’re working with service based businesses only, as we don’t want to burden ourselves with e-commerce functionality at the start, although we do have this as an option, it just requires some extra coding.

If you’re wondering how we’re offering this service for free, our platform offers website hosting and we also have a marketing agency so developing these connections will only help us work with the next big upcoming businesses. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
- Does this sound like something you or a small business owner you know would use?
- What features would make a platform like this a no brainer for you?
- Any feedback on the concept or launch strategy?

If you’re curious to see how it works, just drop me a message - happy to arrange a call or I can share the website if you want to test it out for yourself.

Looking forward to your thoughts and advice! I’m here to learn from the community and improve where I can. ",0,startups,1733928027.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbux45/ive_built_an_ai_website_builder_and_its_free_to/
1hbch7r,Do we need a co-founder or an employee?,"Hi,

We're a B2C startup that just surpassed $12k MRR, bootstrapped, and we're also doing a spinoff - a B2B product that grew from a personal pain point we experienced while growing our B2C business through SEO. We have some early traction with B2B, but B2C remains our primary source of revenue.

We've also raised a very small FFF round to accelerate our growth. We're a very small team at the moment, just two brothers as co-founders. I'm the CEO/CTO, technical, write code and sell, with lots of experience from working at YC and big tech. My brother is non-technical, a CPO/CMO blend, responsible for marketing, product, operations, and customer support. We also have two hired people: a content marketer and a software engineer.

Our blind spots are structure, project management, and strategy. We all hate routine and project management. I feel a need for someone to step into a role to help us ""get organized.""

A friend of mine organically approached us and made himself useful on several fronts. He helped us think through our goals and financial projections. He's really good with data, holds a PhD in computer science, but he's more of a Data Science person. We also get along very well (I've known him for 10 years now but never worked on any substantial project together). He's also remote. I'm in SF, my brother's in Warsaw, and he's in Amsterdam.

Now we want to make a decision about whether to make him an offer as a co-founder. Help me think this through. Here are the questions I've asked myself so far:

1. Would this person increase the probability of success for this company? Yes, I think he will. But maybe if I looked more intentionally, I'd find someone who would accelerate us even faster. I'm not sure.
2. Can I hire this person? No, I can't. His salary is north of $300k yearly, and we wouldn't be able to afford that.
3. Are his skills complementary to ours? Yes, he has much better presentation skills than anyone in our group. He also has a PhD, which looks good on paper and will attract better talent.
4. Do we get along? Yes, I feel comfortable in his presence and would love to hang out together.

His role would be something like chief of staff, plus he could help with engineering.

Now, I know this is a lot of words, but what questions should I ask myself before making him a co-founder or deciding otherwise?",4,startups,1733865216.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbch7r/do_we_need_a_cofounder_or_an_employee/
1hb7bu8,Should I Quit My Job to Pursue My Startup Idea?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads and could really use some advice. I work as an staff applied research scientist in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and during my job, I’ve identified a significant problem in the process of data generation for RAG systems. I’ve come up with an idea that I believe can solve this problem effectively—not just for my current company but for any organization that relies on document-based systems.

Here’s the situation:
- The idea is not specific to my company; it’s a general solution that could benefit various industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.

- I haven’t built anything yet, but I’ve started planning the product and am confident it could work.

- My current employment contract likely restricts me from working on side projects without disclosure.

I’m torn between two options:
- Stay at my job and work on the idea as a side project: This would allow me to validate the idea without taking a big financial risk. However, it feels slow, and I’m concerned about any potential conflict with my employer.

- Quit my job and go all-in on the startup: This would give me the freedom to focus entirely on the idea, but it’s a big leap, and I’d need to rely on my savings until the startup gains traction.

For context:
- I have savings to support myself (single no kids) for a 1 year.

- I’m passionate about solving this problem and feel this idea has real potential.

- I want to act ethically and ensure I’m not violating any legal agreements.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I quit my job and take the risk, or try to balance both until the idea gains traction?

Any advice, experiences, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1hbnnwg,How to Crush Facebook Ads with a Small Budget,"Running Facebook ads successfully with a small budget is not only possible but often recommended for new advertisers. Starting small allows you to minimize financial risk while learning the platform and optimizing campaigns. Here's a step-by-step guide to maximizing results on a tight budget.

# Defining a Small Budget

* **Small Budget**: Less than $3,300 per month (\~$100/day).
* **Tiny Budget**: Less than $600 per month (\~$20/day).

Starting small is wise because initial campaigns might not perform well. Once profitable, you can scale confidently.

# 1. Copy What Works Best in Your Industry

With limited funds, avoid testing too many variables. Instead:

* Use the **Meta Ads Library** (free tool) to analyze competitors' ads.
* Focus on ads that have been running for months; these are likely successful.
* Model your ads on these examples, including style, format, and language, but avoid outright copying.

Shortcut your success by leveraging others' testing efforts.

# 2. Reduce the Number of Variables

* Focus on selling **one product or service** at a time, preferably:
   * Your best-selling item.
   * The item with the highest profit margin.
* Keep campaigns simple with fewer ad sets and ads.

This approach helps Meta gather sufficient data and optimizes performance faster.

# 3. Trust Meta’s Algorithms

Rely on tools like **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns** or **Advantage+ Audiences** to let Meta optimize targeting and placement. Avoid experimental tactics that could risk your small budget.

Meta’s systems are designed to deliver results, especially when campaigns align with platform recommendations.

# 4. Be Willing to Spend More on Conversions

Set realistic expectations for return on ad spend (ROAS):

* For beginners, aiming for a **2x–4x ROAS** is reasonable.
* Aggressively spend up to your break-even point to gain initial customers.

The goal is not immediate profitability but scaling, gathering conversion data, and building brand awareness for long-term success.

# 5. Avoid Brand Awareness Campaigns

For small budgets:

* Focus on **lead generation** or **sales campaigns**.
* Avoid vague objectives like ""getting your business out there.""

Exception: **Omnipresent content strategies** can work for small audiences but are niche-specific.

# 6. Avoid Constantly Tweaking Campaigns

Frequent adjustments reset the **learning phase**, hindering optimization. To maximize success:

* Allow campaigns to run for a sufficient period to gather data.
* Adjust based on **conversion volume**, not arbitrary timeframes.

Smaller budgets mean longer learning phases, so patience is key.

# 7. Niche Down Your Audience

Target a specific subsection of your market to:

* Tailor messaging effectively.
* Stand out from generic ads targeting broad audiences.

For example, instead of marketing broadly, position yourself as a specialist in a specific industry, like SaaS businesses. Expand gradually as you scale.

# 8. Embrace New Features and Strategies

Leverage your small business agility by quickly adopting:

* New Meta features.
* Innovative ad strategies.

Larger companies often move slower due to complex decision-making processes, giving smaller advertisers a competitive advantage.

# Conclusion

Running Facebook ads with a small budget requires strategic planning and patience. By focusing on what works, trusting Meta’s tools, and avoiding common pitfalls, you can achieve success and scale your campaigns over time. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your results grow.",0,startups,1733899607.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbnnwg/how_to_crush_facebook_ads_with_a_small_budget/

my cofounder and i are 2-man team. he is the tech and i am the marketing/growth. i came up with the idea last week, pitched it to him, he built it in 2 days, and we dropped it. no posts on reddit, no paid ads, no influencers or creators, just by asking and making friends. our goal for this specific project is to grow and build a community around it. it aint gonna make us millions but what's valuable is the platform and users we'll be able to reach.

here are few tips to tech founders who lack marketing and sales:

\- build a brand or build a persona online but have a presence

\- interact with soon to be users/customers ahead of time but don't give off corporate/sales vibes, make friends

\- build relationships with your users ahead of time, months ahead ideally but weeks works.

\- always ask, the worst thing a person can say is ""no"", don't be afraid of rejection or being ignored or ghosted

these tips would be your generic tips for any startup, depending on the industry and audience, u'd have to think outside the box.

1hbn3hx,Idea Validation - Ever spent hours wrestling with data from a PDF or invoice? ,"You know the drill: someone sends you a file, and suddenly it’s *your job* to extract all the data manually. Copy-pasting, fixing formatting issues, and double-checking everything. By the time you’re done, you’re wondering why it felt like such a monumental waste of time.

I’ve been there. And honestly? It’s what inspired me to start building a solution.

Here’s the idea:  
Imagine a tool where you can upload *any* document—PDFs, invoices, contracts, whatever—and it extracts all the important data into a clean, editable table in seconds no OCR training effort required, you just tell what you want to extract regardless of the format and it does it for you.

But that’s not all. You could:

* Edit or add custom notes/fields right there.
* Automate the next steps (send data to your CRM, shoot off an email, etc.).
* Validate data through a custom API or save it directly into your database.

Basically, it’s about turning that painful grunt work into an automated workflow. No coding. No headaches. Just fast, clean data you can actually use.

Now, I would like to validate the idea, how do you guys feel about this?

1hbdfhb,5 ways content marketing has changed over the last decade,"I've been in the digital marketing game since 2010, mostly focusing on startups and e-commerce. As I've been prepping to launch a new project, it’s striking just how much the industry has changed over the last decade—and how few of the tactics I would have employed in 2015 are even remotely relevant today.

And since one of my core marketing skills has always been wasting time on Reddit, I thought I’d put some of my thoughts together in a post to see if this tracks with other folks’ experiences.

Here are five ways I’ve seen content marketing evolve over the last decade. What did I miss?

**1. Organic social reach for written content has collapsed**

One of the first startups I worked with built a sizable audience on Facebook simply by creating and sharing fun, engaging blog content. At its peak, this company could post an intriguing blog link and consistently count on tens of thousands of clicks without spending any money on boosting it at all. This was the era of BuzzFeed quizzes, endless listicles, and content designed—for better or worse— to appease the clickbait gods.

But in the mid-to-late 2010s, Facebook introduced changes that completely killed this strategy. Organic reach for links was throttled, while content that kept users on the platform (like videos and native posts) was rewarded. Look up the infamous “pivot to video” for an illustration of how this impacted media brands. For more check out Cory Doctorow’s concept of “enshittification,” a pattern that continues to today.

**2. SEO Is more competitive, niche, and less gameable**

When I first started in marketing, the SEO playbook was riddled with black-hat tactics: keyword stuffing, low-effort link farms, duplicate sites—you name it. But then Google got hip and rolled out a series of algorithm updates that penalized low-quality tactics. Some clients I worked with lost half their SEO traffic overnight as various core algo updates rolled out.

Since then, Google has continued to bang the drum that all it wants is high-quality, useful content that fills the needs of the person searching. Of course, this is not a bad thing, and in-depth, original, and niche content that truly addresses search intent should be rewarded. What's challenging is that over this same period, it's become increasingly difficult to ""win"" at SEO as Google has stuffed its SERPs with ads and new features like those recent AI summaries. SEO remains one of the only viable content channels for startups, but in many ways, it's more competitive and more difficult than ever.

**3. Mobile-first everything**

Even the most professional UX designers (working as they do from their 27-inch monitors) can forget that most web traffic comes from mobile devices. It’s no longer enough for your site to be mobile-friendly—it has to be mobile-first. This has been as much of a change for marketers as it has been for devs and designers. After all, the experience that someone has when landing on mobile page can make or break every one of your marketing metrics and channels.  

**4. The ascent of vertical video**

If you're reading this, than you already know that the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels has fundamentally reshaped content consumption. Vertical video has become the dominant format, and its influence extends far beyond these platforms. Since these apps are more about keeping users on the app than driving them to external links. This shift forces marketers to rethink how they approach content creation. Instead of using social media as a referral engine, it’s all about building brand awareness and engaging directly with audiences. And even this has already started to become more difficult (see again, ""enshittification"").

**5. The AI revolution (and/or apocalypse)**

Finally, there’s the six-fingered elephant in the room: AI. The rise of tools like ChatGPT et al has already transformed content marketing workflows with new AI-driven tools cropping up every day. While we’re still in the early days of the AI revolution, it’s clear that this isn’t just a fad. AI will continue to reshape how marketers create, distribute, and measure content. I mean, I bet people are reading this post right now who think that it's AI-generated (I swear, it's not though I did use GPT to proofread).

1hb83ab,"Proud of Team, Fully Distributed, Attempt 5","Hi all, 

I posted in r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, but also going to drop updates here as well. I wouldn't call us an ""indie hacker"" team because I'm not a one man show, but we're not ""funded"". I have attempted to build around 5 products in earnest over the last 4 years. Each of which left me about \~10-15K in the red. I learned a lot from each attempt though, and finally feel like I just might make this one work. 

  
This is more of a self-appreciation post, but also a bit of an inspiration post. Getting the right people together—especially when you find them all digitally—can be tough. But now I finally found my groove with these four, it genuinely feels like we’re a team. Everyone has their lane: one has equity in the product, and the others are on weekly pay for now (though I plan to give them equity + better comp as we grow). We’re really driving an interesting product and working together as a solid team (weekly meetings, async comms at all hours, etc). Honestly, I get excited to work on this with them. It’s so cool.

I have been software engineering for almost 3 years. I have been working in startup environment since then. I saw so many takes on landing pages &amp; websites. Some companies don't care at all, some spends over $20k on that, some builds them on their own. What do you think about them? How important are they, for your growth?

I am also thinking, would you pay to outsource entire website management? Or are you open to outsource building website for you + exposing CMS? How much would you pay for high converting website, tailored to needs of your company?

I will provide my answer: I find websites essential for business growth and online exposure, especially for startups, BUT when executed properly. Personally I built several websites, saw so many worse or better performing. I can clearly say, that it's worth to spend &gt;$10k on website, but only it's part of your bigger plan.

1haw07b,Anyone else here have autism / auditory processing disorder (APD) and find going to parties and networking hard?,"I moved back to the bay area from CO primarily because I wanted to do another startup in the AI space.

The problem is I really forgot how much I hate networking and going to parties.

I also have auditory processing disorder (APD) which makes it much harder for me to have discussions in rooms when music is playing or lots of people are taking.

It effectively makes going to super cool events almost pointless to me.

Now I LOVE talking to smart people so if I can hear them I really enjoy it but it's usually in smaller meetings or when people are outside.  

The problem is that this is most of the events I go to.  It's just such a cacophony I can't really focus and just want to leave.

I thought maybe one strategy would be to organize my OWN events that I design to be ideal for me to hear. Like going for hikes or over dinner. Something like that.

Any advice would be awesome!

1hbdz5s,$5.. forever? 😏,"👋🏼 Over the past year, I’ve been diving into software development and product management. Most of my projects have been ambitious and complex (read: nowhere near finished), so I decided to tackle something smaller to gain practical experience.

Recently, I needed to organize my finances for an upcoming move. Instead of creating yet another Google Sheet, I thought, Why not build a simple tool for myself? 🙃

What began as a quick personal project quickly escalated. In just a few days, I developed a full app, complete with a licensing system and a (barebones) marketing site. It’s been a fun learning journey, and it feels great to have something tangible out there instead of endlessly tinkering.

The app is straightforward—it’s an offline finance tool that stores data locally and helps plan finances without relying on bank integrations. While it’s not groundbreaking, it serves my needs and avoids the hassle of dealing with miscategorized transactions.

Here’s where I deviated from the norm: I opted for a $5 lifetime license instead of the typical subscription model. I understand that subscriptions are standard in SaaS, and this approach likely won’t make me rich. However, I wanted to experiment with simplicity and see if a one-time price could still attract interest.

So far, a few sales have come in, boosting my confidence. But I’m curious: Does this kind of pricing make sense for small, low-maintenance tools like this? Or am I missing the mark by not adopting the subscription model?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this pricing experiment and any similar experiences you’ve had. Thanks for reading!",0,startups,1733869091.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbdz5s/5_forever/

1hb3vc6,Customer Success software? ,"Hi!

I've noticed a lot of sales/CRM platforms work primarily on sales funnel and conversions; mostly to close deals. But I've been looking for 'post sales', basically making sure customers onboard properly, use the products the right way etc. I've worked in the past with a couple of larger, more mature startups who predominantly went with enterprise level customers and they're using jury-rigged CRMs to manage those relationships. So they make sure they're touching base with them and they essentially create new 'pipelines' and triggers to check in with a customer if they haven't in a while or if the customer makes a certain action.

I've found what I've been looking at is essentially account management and customer success, but there doesn't appear to many tools specifically for this area. Where they are they're looking purely at retention and churn rather than relationship building and upsell. Am I in a bit of a bubble because of the startups I've worked with, or is this just an area that doesn't get that much focus?",1,startups,1733843363.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hb3vc6/customer_success_software/

1hafrv8,Your thoughts on fractional CXOs?,"I was a startup CTO (and co-founder) but after a long 8 year grind I decided to step down. Main reason: the company entered a new phase with main focus on sales and scaling with much less innovation. Came to a point where I simply felt done and started to hate my job.

Took the company from 0 to 1 and grew product and engineering teams from 3 to 40 people. After stepping down I got a handful of offers from other startups but politely declined and took a well-needed sabbatical. Wasn't mentally ready to commit to a new journey just yet. A fellow CTO friend suggested that I try consulting as Fractional CTO. Loved the idea and the flexibility but quickly noticed that the majority of smaller and early-stage startups had tiny budgets and were looking for a lead engineer and not a CTO. While I do love to code I also love to lead people and build teams and culture. 

I understand that you can't bring in a fractional CTO if your company already has a CTO but I also see many in this sub looking for a technical co-founder. In my head, a fractional CTO is the perfect candidate. It's the least risky way to try work together and see if there is personal chemistry and vibe. If we enjoy working together and I believe in the idea I would even strongly consider joining the team if offered. 

On to my question:

I am still figuring out my ICP and where to find the right people (Linkedin sucks ) and wanted to ask people here what their views on fractionals are in general. Have you worked with any? In what phase? If not, did you consider it? Why not?

Please share your honest thoughts, experiences, and of course, opinions!

Thoughts on this idea for a student ticket p2p


is is an (albeit not very original) small idea I've had over the past day, looking to see if it would be viable on a small scale.

Essentially, I'm a college student that's noticed that the ticket market is kinda fucked for alot of students, particularly for reselling and ticket exchanges, students often have to go through WhatsApp in groups, there are alot of scams, and it's not very secure.

the central idea of this is a student-centred p2p marketplace to buy, sell and exchange tickets for (mainly) student events. It could potentially partner with different student groups and societies on campuses, exclusive pre-sale access, possibly local venue partnerships as well, for student discounts of early-bird pricing. There would be price-caps to prevent extreme scalping, and two-factor authenticators using student ID to keep out fraudulent activity.

Revenue generation could come from a small transaction fees, subscription plans, advertising etc. 

There are alot of different ticket apps out there right now, what sets this idea apart is the focus on students and alleviate their specific pain-points. what do you think?",0,startups,1733787955.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hao27x/thoughts_on_this_idea_for_a_studentfocused_ticket/

I have been working at a startup for a couple of months as the founding engineer brought on. Our MVP has been built and started making money but there are no outside investors currently.

I am trying to figure out what my expectations should be for equity now that the legal papers are finished.

We are currently bootstrapped and unsure if investors will be needed. The current equity situation has 25% designated for employees and investors - they want to give me 5-6% because they say that investors will be unlikely to invest if given more equity than this and that 5-6% is already triple the market value for equity for an employee (if we had any money to give me a salary as well).

I feel like because I am working for free and will probably be working for free for the next months / year currently that I should be in the range of 10-15%, but I got the sense that they thought this was unreasonable.

1hamrkm,startup ios name advice,"for context im building an ios app in a niche area and i came up with a pretty creative and name that i love - it’s directly related to the niche im building and its a simple but memorable name.

the only problem is that there is someone else in the same niche space who had a similar idea to me with the same name on the App Store. they seem like a small builder with a history of making two apps, but the app im talking about only has 2 reviews for stars and hasn’t been updated in over a year.

even though i am in the same space as the other app and planned to use the name in a fun unique way like the other app, my apps execution is completely different from design to function (even though they address the same problem)

im not that worried about the other app impacting my new apps search because even the other app doesn’t show up in the top 3 for its name - so if people love what I build im hoping my search results will be much better

my main issue right now is that I’ve fallen in love with the name. I came up with it when I first was building the app and now im really really disappointed a very small outdated app has the same one.

I know names don’t mean everything but this one I felt meant a lot as a ios app where the name is also tied to the meaning and ways to market / distribute the app.

there’s no trademark on the name I checked - would you recommend me still using the same name? I know apple has a strict policy but im hoping my execution and actual final product being much better and unique can be enough (especially since the other app hasn’t been updated or used much)

1ha6q7c,"Story about ""re-starting"" successful startup","I have been working on a startup related to 3D printer management. Over the last few years, this segment has changed a lot—new competitors have appeared, and we’re slowly achieving nice numbers in terms of users and new subscriptions.

A year ago, we realized that instead of focusing on creating precise solutions to integrate all 3D printers into our software, the real focus should be on the process itself—the workflow of how 3D models are created and prepared for printing. We always thought we needed to create an end-to-end solution, from the moment the 3D model is created to the time the printer starts working. But this is an incredibly complex problem as a whole, and not all parts of it need solving.

Our biggest target group right now is schools, where the process begins in the classroom with students and their projects. They create a model, send it for review to the teacher, schedule it for printing alongside others, and finally, it gets printed. Interestingly, the last part—the actual printing, which is the most difficult from a ""technical"" perspective—is the least important in the process.

We tried to implement all these steps into our application, but in the end, we built a very complex piece of software that didn’t solve the most critical parts of the workflow.

With all this in mind, I decided to leave this startup and start a new one, bringing with me all the experience and new perspectives I’ve gained. This time, I’m starting from the beginning—thinking before coding. I’m trying to adhere to all the concepts I know exist, but as someone ""over-experienced,"" I sometimes skipped steps in the past. Now, I’m learning to share my ideas publicly, I’ve created a ""signup waitlist"" page for my new startup, and I’m genuinely excited to see how things unfold.

This time, I want to truly enjoy the startup journey. I feel like I have more space, time, and the opportunity to do things properly. And who knows—maybe in the future, my ""old startup"" will evolve into the new one, solving old problems from a fresh perspective.

I just wanted to share this mindset change. It’s been incredibly liberating to leave behind the ""full bag"" that was weighing me down and embrace this ""light running.""",9,startups,1733739748.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ha6q7c/story_about_restarting_successful_startup/
1had5t1,"When a larger company acquires a small SaaS startup, how much do they care about the current team?","To clarify: it seems obvious that you would sell your saas solution because the acquiring company wants the technology and can use it. 
 However, do you think it’s also common that they would value the team because they produced good work in the past, and could hopefully produce more good things/expand the application?  

I can see it being necessary to keep on some of the engineers to perform maintenance, train other staff, incorporate into the other company.  

The reason I’m asking this is because I’m trying to help understand how our current sass company can position itself for acquisition. My CEO seems to think that having the **potential** to solve more market problems (eg by leveraging the current platform, and because the team has a history of some innovative solutions) is something valuable.  Me on the other hand, I feel like the current platform with all his current abilities, is what the only real value that any potential buyer would care about.

1h9v6dj,Technical founder here - What's your take on outsourcing MVP development? How much would you pay?,"

Hey fellow founders,

As a technical founder who's been in the startup ecosystem for a while, I've noticed a significant rise in MVP development agencies. While I can code, I've been wondering about the general sentiment around outsourcing MVP development, especially given time constraints and the need to focus on other aspects of the business.

I'm curious:

1. Would you consider hiring someone to build your MVP, even as a technical founder? Why or why not?

2. The big question - what's your threshold for MVP development cost? What would you consider a reasonable budget for a solid MVP? (I'm seeing ranges from $5K to $50K+ and honestly not sure what's reasonable anymore)

Would love to hear from those who've gone this route:
- What did you pay?
- Was it worth it?
- Any regrets?

Also, if you chose NOT to outsource, I'd love to hear your reasoning.

P.S. Not looking to outsource right now, just trying to understand the market dynamics and what other founders think is a fair price point for MVP development.",47,startups,1733698334.0,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9v6dj/technical_founder_here_whats_your_take_on/
1hanls4,"Our New Facebook Ads Strategy that made us 7.5 ROAS
","Dude this was crazy!  
  
This is how we've been consistently generating 5-10 ultra qualified. leads per day for our SaaS using facebook ads and conditional logic  
  
We used to struggle because our ads tend to attract a lot of ""wannabe entrepreneurs"" that would sign up then cancel the next month because their business wasn't running yet  
  
Now we attract only people that already have a running business and are looking for a better tool to do their everyday priority tasks  
  
**First - The Ad creatives**  
  
You know, your Saas should be a better alternative to a pre-existing method of executing an everyday task   
  
The idea is: your customer needs to execute a few tasks everyday that are essential for the business to run  
  
Simple example: the uber driver has to drive towards the clients pickup spot  
  
Your Saas should be a superior tool when compared to the traditional method (example: chainsaw vs. hacksaw)  
  
Your facebook ad creative should be a video announcing the viewer that your tool exists and that you're capable of performing XYZ tasks faster and/or cheaper. That's it.  
  
Try to use an instagram Reel format.   
  
**Second - The ad form**  
  
Our biggest shift here was to use facebook's native form.  
  
We plugged it into a google sheets spreadsheet and the form answers  come automatically into the spreadsheet.  
  
But what changed it all was using the ""conditional logic"" feature.  
  
Basically, when you turn it on, you can choose one or more questions that will define an answer as ""qualified"" or not.  
  
So now facebook will only consider those types of answers as an actual ""lead"".  
  
**THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING**  
  
Last month we spent 4k in ads and generated 30k in revenue.  
  
This month we managed to reduce the cost per lead to 1/3rd, plus we doubled our daily ad spend so we're excited for that.  
  
That was only possible due to the increase in lead quality that allowed us to have 24k paid in fulls (2 year contract)   
  
Facebook's native lead form also allowed👉 us to have cheaper leads without losing quality of leads.   
👉I suspect this happened because when the traffic goes to your website facebook have a hard time to track it, but with the native lead form, this is no problem since the traffic is still in facebook.  
  
So recap:  
  
\- your ad creative should attack the inferior alternative to your Saas product  
\- use facebook's native form with the conditional logic turned ON  
\- get Rich

1hacs3q,Finding investors for consumer app,"
Hi,

I'm a technical founder (incorporated) for a new friend and date-finding app launching in Vancouver, Canada. Before you roll your eyes, I want to say that this is near and dear to my heart. So much so that I want to change the industry by offering the most important features for free and significantly undercut popular apps. There will be in-app purchases, yes. But I want to give the people the tools they need to find what they are looking for.

The MVP for iOS and Android is 70% done, and now I'm looking for potential investors to get this off the ground. The expensive part will be chat and database fees, as well as initial marketing in Vancouver (where it will be launched first), to make people aware of the app.

I'm new to all this, and I've learned a lot. But I have no clue how to find and approach people with money, that want to invest in a b2c app.

I would appreciate any tips, contacts, etc. Slide deck available.

As a technical founder myself, I find that I and others I have met, lack domain knowledge for an industry other than tech. This makes it harder for us to build vertical SaaS. On the other hand, non technical folks don't have a way to build using AI without knowing the technical details of managing AI and the right architecture to use.

A platform where you can pick and choose components for an app. Provide it your own data and then let AI do the heavy lifting.

1h9wg0m,Would you use this?,"If you are a digital business owner or manager and have a team or VA(s).. and like to move FAST.. I believe this is for you. 

I fit in that category. I always have the need to create a task and delegate it but I hate breaking flow. This happens when I’m in my inbox or browsing the internet. I will want my VA to follow up on something or my content person to turn a report into a blog post, but I have to stop what I’m doing to create the task and delegate it.

I tried using look but still takes too much time and it breaks slow. I tried using some of the voice to tasks ones but they want me to manage the task their too. I even tried using iPhone shortcuts but I was like this can’t be the only way.

The goal is to not break flow, record the screen and my voice, and have the software create the task name/description and even auto assign it to whatever task system I already work in.

I do not want to have to change screens and reduce breaking flow.

Literally like a screen grab software but it will use AI to create the task name, task description, step by step process, link to the video or voice, find the persons name to assign it, associate it to a project, and send it to the software you integrated it too (e.g Asana, notion, slack, etc)

1h9kdd2,Gross Revenue Sharing? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all doing well.   
  
A few months ago, I was researching effective ways to distribute revenue to early business partners in a startup. Specifically, I explored methods like compensating people with equity instead of a salary. During my research though, I found that many individuals who chose to accept equity over a salary in various startups later regretted their decision. A common reason was that some founders often found creative ways to avoid paying dividends. I came across this issue repeatedly through blogs and videos shared by people who experienced it firsthand.   
  
And even if the founders are trustworthy, a late-stage investor with a majority share could intentionally structure the company's finances to ensure profits are funneled toward their own interests, so that early contributors are left with nothing.

After doing some more research, however, I discovered this amazing thing called 'Gross Revenue Sharing'. Gross revenue sharing is a contractual agreement where payouts are based on the gross revenue—the total income a company earns before any expenses are deducted—rather than profits made. 

For example, an agreement might stipulate that if you work for the company for a specific period (say, five years) and meet a clear set of predetermined goals year after year, you will receive a fixed percentage of gross revenue (e.g., 0.001%) annually for the next 50 years(or whatever other number of years would be fair). This ensures a guaranteed reward that is not subject to potentially manipulated profit margins.

This way seems much safer and more secure than the usual equity or profit-sharing deals. And that's why I wanted to ask, with all these benefits, it makes me wonder why gross revenue sharing isn’t more common in the tech industry. Is it because people don’t know about it, doubt it would work, or is there another reason?",11,startups,1733669306.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kdd2/gross_revenue_sharing/

1h9vcrh,Investor Search and Responses,"I do SaaS fintech b2b. Very long sales cycles traditionally. I tried to raised $1M in a seed round back in Oct '23. First time Founder (but with 10years xp in my industry) and it was terrible. Wasted 6 months figuring out how to talk to these dummies.

At the time I had 3 clients which is big in my space, most startups fail to get the first client. I ended up only getting $400K, 1 check from a VC and 1 from an existing client. The VC is cool, but when they made intros to their friends it fell apart. The biggest feedback was that they didn't feel that the product was ""defence-able"".

On average, large competitors close 2-3 deals a month with a whole sales team and a marketing team. Solo, I did matched by myself. My product is just 10x better and I know how to sell. 

I now have 15 clients and those will be roughly ~ $1M arr once fully implemented. 3 of 12 major competitors are pulling out of the industry because they suck and the business is too tough for them. I need to take their market share in '25. 

My last VC is in for $500k again, term sheet in hand. 3 clients are pitching in $250k combined. The VC however wants me to raise atleast $1M this time however. (We agree on this number, but it's not necessary for me but they think it is). 

So. I hate talking to VC. I have very little tolerance for them taking time away from my family and my clients. How do I go back previous VC that passed and tell them to give me money in as few words as possible? 

Plan B, is to shoot a text out to all the other start-up CEOs I have made friends with over the last decade, and tell them know I need $250K to round out a $1M raise and see who's going to do me a solid a make an intro. 

If I go outside my existing network, do I have to actually make a pitch deck? Or can I get away without that, or half-ass it. Really don't want to spend the hours to make it perfect. I expect to grow to $5M ARR next year and grow faster than any other company in the space. But I won't do that if I waste my time begging folks for money over Zoom. 

Looking for advice or to vent. The VC world borderline doesn't make sense to me. Why make 100 phone calls to raise $250K and when I make 100 phone calls to earn $1M arr?

1h9kczb,Hesitate if I should release my app that has an major defect.,"Here is the background story. I made an app
that help people to learn music staff. The app will show a note on the screen and let users play it, then, it will listen to what users are playing and compute the frequency via a pitch detection algorithm. If the user does play the right note, he will gain a score. The problem is, the algorithm, provided by a small open source library, suffers from octave error. That is, it will give you doubled or half frequency of the pitch that the user's playing, and this situation happens quite often. This make the app produce falsy result. For example, the app shows a A4 note (the frequency is 440hz), and when a user plays a A3 note (the frequency is 220hz), there is a great chance the app thinks the user plays the right note, because the algorithm outputs a false doubled frequency of what the user's playing (A3). To fix this problem requires lots of efforts for me. Either I have to try different open source libraries and evaluate them, or even write my own algorithm. It is really time-consuming.

As what Learn Startup says, I should build a MVP ASAP and find out whether it is what my customers want, so I am considering to release my app now, even it is far from perfect. However I am also fear that releasing an app with such obvious defect will give them a really bad impression about the app. Since I am going to promote the app to music teachers near my place, and I think it is not easy to find one that is willing to try my app, if they dislike it because of the defect, they won't become my users and give me feedback, and I won't know if the app idea is viable. However if I choose to solve to octave error, I might end up wasting time, since I don't know if people need it. Now I really don't know what should I do.",4,startups,1733669273.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kczb/hesitate_if_i_should_release_my_app_that_has_an/
1h94egx,Incentives sound low to join as a founding engineer,"Assuming you get a 4 year vesting schedule and say the company it gets acquired in M&amp;A deal the year or two after you join. Then what's the buyers incentive for keeping the upside on employee equity vs just reducing it to market based compensation?

Example an employee takes a haircut in pay to join a startup, that does well and gets acquired. The employee may have turned their 400k grant to 2M with 2 years left to vest. The acquiring company can determine this is overpaying and reduce their compensation to market pay - let's say 250k stock per year instead of 500K. 

Wouldn't this be less incentive to join a startup vs the alternative of big tech (which will have “uncapped” upside on stock growth + annual refreshers).

1h9347e,I Scaled Two E-Commerce Brands to $1M in Annual Revenue Simultaneously within 2 Years — Here's My Story,"I wanted to share my journey of scaling *two* e-commerce brands to $1M in annual revenue at the same time within two years. It wasn’t easy, and I didn’t follow some “perfect formula.” My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I’m not sharing this as an attempt to “gain karma” or whatever and I’m not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here’s the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I’d “made it.” Spoiler: I hadn’t.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started—broke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I’d ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. “This is it,” I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn’t last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he’d quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in “Print on Demand” platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn’t know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn’t about print on demand—it was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1️⃣ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2️⃣ Make it higher quality.  
3️⃣ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she’s the skeptical type, but she was on board—which made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1️⃣ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it’s not great, it won’t last.  
2️⃣ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3️⃣ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn’t have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here’s the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you’re stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

“The difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it’s literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it’s a choice.”  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It’s up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

Right now, we’re making around $65 in small monthly sales, while I pay $130 and my associate $200 out of pocket to cover food for the insects and electricity. Some tasks, like producing more insects, are easier than building something like an oven to dry them.

Our goals include:

• Increasing sales

• Producing our own chicken feed

• Selling compost as a by-product

• Entering the biotech market with products like chitosan

Currently, we have one part-time employee and occasionally hire a second person on a day-to-day basis. I want to hire a friend with extensive entomology experience who worked at a mealworm startup (to which I sold the original colony for $3k), but I can’t afford to hire him full-time. I’m considering paying him a daily rate and having him work a few times a month.

I’d like to buy a solar dryer to start prototyping chicken feed with the BSF but feel unsure about how to move forward. I also own two generic domain names but think we need a better business name. I believe we should create a LinkedIn page, ask friends to share on social media, and build our presence online.

We are bootstrapped, what is fair?","I run a sales agency, we provide outsourced sales services to other businesses or startups, from lead generation to closing contracts. We are a team of account executives with years of sales experience, most of us were previously in tech sales. We have clients who have hired us as their outsourced sales team so there is revenue already coming into the business. Right now we use third-party VoIP calling services, email services, and CRMs (i.e. Salesforce) on a subscription basis paid for by the clients so they can have access to the entire sales process for transparency. It gets pricey for them and we'd like to instead develop our own proprietary software platform that integrates VoIP, CRM, and sales tools. We obviously cannot create a VoIP service from scratch but we can for everything else, so we'll just be integrating the VoIP through API from our preferred provider. This way we can offer the same services to our clients in a more affordable and reliable way through our proprietary software.

I've been interviewing for a Technical Product Manager position that will eventually develop to the Chief Technology Officer as the company grows. The TPM will lead the development of the software platform, managing the software engineers/devs who will also be compensated in equity or hired on a contract basis, and pretty much leading the vision of the product. I'll  be reviewing final interviews soon and can't decide on the exact details of compensation. 

We own 100% of the company, and other ""employees"" we have outside of us are contracted and compensated with commissions or on a job by job basis, but for this TPM position, it will be different. Whoever I hire will be on this with us for long run. They will have to be as dedicated and excited about this startup as we are.

I've read of the possibility of providing equity over the months or as milestones are met. The people I'm interviewing have experience in product management, managing software teams, and development.

1h9s097,Repost with more info: How do I show tens of ideas for cofounders to choose without getting my ideas stolen?,"Ok, let me repost this because I didn't explain and obviously it went out of control: people went with the usual ""Nobody will steal your ideas"" or the ""idea is nothing without execution”.

Please read, and I hope you can help me.

Hi guys, I have lots of startup ideas and I was wondering which was the best way to share these ideas with possible technical cofounders for them to choose without getting my ideas exposed.

The goal would be to create a startup lab where students and new devs can pick and choose what they want to develop (based on their skills and experience) to learn how to be a startupper and be guided by this lab.

I already received green light from the townhall and our university that will allocate resources to fund this lab and the ideas that will be born from it.

Trust me, if I just wanted to make money it would be much easier to just gather investors and launch the ideas in the list starting from the best to the worst but I'm not doing this for money, at least not only for that.
I genuinely want to do good, I want to create something that will help people create new things and new companies in this new environment where they’re guided, without the risk of more experienced startuppers or software houses stealing the “formative” work.

I could talk literally for hours about this thing but please trust me that I'm not a random guy that just wants to protect his ideas while he talks to devs.

So going back to the “problem”:

Obviously I can't make them sign NDAs for tens, maybe even a hundred, of ideas, and I can't even make them sign a single NDA for all of them because then the contract won't be specific enough.

how would you do? ",0,startups,1733689781.0,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9s097/repost_with_more_info_how_do_i_show_tens_of_ideas/

1h8g50t,I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer,"Had a beer with a buddy of mine the other day—he’s a CRO at a 130-person tech startup. Out of nowhere, he’s like, “Man, I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer.” Not gonna lie, I laughed at first, but then I realized he was dead serious.

So I ask him what’s up, and he just starts venting. He said the hardest part is he feels like he’s supposed to know everything that’s happening in the company, but it’s impossible. Marketing’s doing one thing, sales is doing another, and customer success is in their own little world. And somehow, he’s supposed to connect all the dots and make the revenue grow?

Then he talks about how he has all these big plans—like where they need to be in 6 months, how they should be scaling, all that good stuff. But when it comes to actually putting those plans into action, it’s a mess. Teams don’t align, priorities clash, and stuff just doesn’t get done. He said it feels like no matter how much effort he puts in, something’s always slipping through the cracks.

His exact words: “It’s like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it’s lost deals and missed opportunities. And I’m the only one holding the hammer.”

Honestly, it sounded rough, and it got me wondering—do other CROs feel this way too?

If you’re a CRO (or close to one), what’s the hardest part of your job? Is it the lack of visibility, the struggle to get stuff done, or something else? 

Would love to hear how you deal with it.

1h8pt5k,Cold email works! here's my experience/recommended tools,"I’ve been sending cold email outreach - both for sales of my PR agency and database and to contact journalists/creators on behalf of clients - for around 3 months now.

Stone cold. Zero prior relationship. At massive scale (with AI).

And I was skeptical. But guess what? It works.

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I’ve learnt a ton so far that’s helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don’t rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

Google Workspace  
Apollo  
Coldsire  
Clay  
Instantly

If you’re not cold email outreach with AI, try it! You’d be surprised. Happy to answer more specific questions.",19,startups,1733567604.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h8pt5k/cold_email_works_heres_my_experiencerecommended/

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur discussing some AI product ideas with potential customers and engineers to get feedback. My goal is to have open and collaborative conversations but also ensure everyone is on the same page regarding roles and expectations.

I want to avoid situations where someone thinks they deserve equity or ownership just for providing input. However, I also really value these relationships and don't want them to sour due to misunderstandings. Protecting the work is important but maintaining trust and goodwill is equally critical.

I'm looking for advice from other founders on how to strike the right balance:

* What's the best way to communicate upfront to avoid incorrect expectations?
* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

My aim is to build strong, productive connections while being transparent. I don't want to be overly guarded but also want to mitigate the risk of misunderstandings that could undermine trust.

I’m pricing the online community in two membership tiers. One oriented towards aspiring students thinking about entering a specific field, and existing students across 15 or so US universities at a price point to $49.95 a month. The next tier is professional level, existing community members in early to mid career, looking to connect with professionals in the industry at a price point of $99 a month.

Those who are in this industry are fairly affluent. It is hard to enter the industry, and 99% of those who do go through a masters program. 

Building critical mass early is important. I’ve thought about, but I’ve decided not to offer a free tier. My concern being that the community is flooded with wannabes and ultimately would devalue the community. 

I’m trying to solve for Network effect. I currently do not have any members.

I thought about offering coupon codes to industry insiders they could pass out to others to join that would provide for a period of free access to the site so long as they use a credit card to sign up. I thought about swag after the second month of payment. I’m going to be using an affiliate program , so any new users can refer others for a percentage of the revenue.

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could! 

  
TLDR: 2 week hire wants to be CFO (they are good at what they do so far) what is the best way to judge if they are suitable and what would be a good compensation model for them given they are not a cofounder?

1h8prw9,"I made around $1000+ by making an AI based Tech Freelance Platform, not sure how to reach more clients","So, I have been doing freelancing myself for a while and also been a client as well and have been really troubled with tons of problem plaguing most of these freelance sites pertaining to finding the right freelancer, security, scams, management of project etc. So, I went out to create my own freelance site with the intention of solving these problems:

For the Clients we intent to solve the following problems:

 

• The hassle to find the best candidate for their tech project

• Fear of scams, incomplete/substandard work or getting ghosted by programmers

• Lack of accountability by any freelance site regarding the work of their freelancers

• Regular Management and Coordination of the project between multiple programmers

 

For the Candidates looking for tech projects we are helping them in the following way:

 

• Help find suitable projects which suits their skill and experience

• Opportunity to pool their talent on a bigger project and work with people with different skills and experience.

• Build skills working on real world project and also earn money doing so.

• Even as a beginner, start with free projects to earn points and earn enough points to apply for paid projects.

I reached out to my past clients and other contacts and they were delighted to see this and was able to secure around $1000 of project. I have already exhausted my personal contact and I don’t really use social media as such.

1h91q7g,I’m building an open source AI marketing bot that you can run for FREE (using Ollama),"We all know how valuable Reddit is for shilling your product (just look at this sub). A lot of founders are using it to promote their products.

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I’ve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it’s so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I’ve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I’ve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don’t deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I’m basically running it for free.

Would be curious about if anyone would like to give it a try. I’m building it as an open source tool, but I don’t have any docs yet. So leave a comment for me to know there would be interest and I’ll write docs so you can run it yourself.

Last thing I want to say: I also hate reddit bots and the idea with this tool is not to spam my product. I’m fine tuning it to behave just as I would manually and limiting the number of comments it can post in a day.",0,startups,1733604073.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h91q7g/im_building_an_open_source_ai_marketing_bot_that/

1h892yq,"I launched my MVP, started with the sales. This is what I found out:","Spoiler: I am not able to make a sale, and I don't see it as a bad thing.

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

1h8cue9,Seeking Manufacturer for New Invention,"I recently came up with a unique invention that I have patented. It is essentially a cat hammock that attaches to your computer chair. I have demonstrated demand with a few viral videos showing off my prototype and I have many thousands express interest in buying it. The problem is that it takes me about 5 days to produce one unit because I have to rely on 3D printing all my parts so I am looking to partner with a manufacturer to satisfy demand and lower the price point.  
Since my invention is rather unique, I am having trouble thinking of another a similar mass-produced product that I can find a factory for -- maybe a computer chair manufacturer might have synergies?

Does anyone have experience finding reputable manufacturers on Alibaba or better yet, does anyone have any direct connections with a manufacturer that would be willing to work with a scrappy startup? I am not opposed to working with a US manufacturer or with an Offshore Manufacturing Sourcing Agent.

1h80z8i,Switching from Bubble io to an agency for equity,"Hey everyone,

Like everyone else, I was looking for a technical founder but couldn't find myself a match so I went for the no code development on my own and built a MVP with bubble io 

I launched it last year and now I have about 6k users with daily active users 600-700 and I'm looking at a pattern of growth. 6 months ago, I had about 470ish users but now they are growing fast.

Its an app in a certain niche so I don't expect it go much high but still the community is growing. 

Here's the issue which I am facing:

My costs are escalating for Bubble and my WUs have passed 1.5 million, and now I am close to getting billed in 1k on monthly basis. On top of that, I want to do something with the app which I can't do technically. 

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

I also received quotations from 5 agencies more and it was around 35-65k USD and on top of that a maintenance and support contract.

I do have a job and not enough cash as well. Do I have any other options?",14,startups,1733490542.0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h80z8i/switching_from_bubble_io_to_an_agency_for_equity/

1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I’d love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team’s mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team’s energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project’s progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can’t do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important to recognize that. Admitting that you can’t do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it’s more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

Do the investors force the single-founder to vest?

Honestly, I'm sure some founders can get away with it if they have insane numbers.

Since the past 4 months I've working on an online shopping app for my country, as there is a huge gap in the apps space here. I know zero coding and had hired a developer for cheap to develop the app for me, now the app is almost complete but i'm unsure about what i'll do for the maintenance of the app since the guy I was working with says that he'll be too busy to give it any tike. 

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code) 

I can either find someone to do maintenance for the app so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what's the procedure for that, what to keep in mind when hiring or giving access to the app, guidelines etc as I have zero tech knowledge. 

Also, if I hire a developer for maintenance, are there any chances he can like steal the app from me? like remove my access or anything (I'm already sorry if any of this sounds super silly) 

Another option I have is learn the basics myself and try to fix minor bugs myself if I come across any.

1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this. I talked with a lawyer friend who said that charging fees is pretty normal, but usually for basic work like this it's a much smaller fee. So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for! It feels a little like a tactic to minimize share transfers by former employees - they're taking it just because they have gatekeeping access. 

I had a great experience with the company and I'm super friendly with the people there still - how would you handle this? Is this something you've seen before?

1h7k5e0,What I Wish I Did Sooner as a New Founder (Advice for You!),"**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here’s the one thing I’d do differently…**

**Document your journey.**

It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you’re working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here’s why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you’re deep in the grind, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you’ve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I’ve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I’ve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I’m bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I’ve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It’s one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you’re just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you’re doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you’re not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I’ve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace — Do’s and Don’ts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don’t**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash’s founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don’t**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub’s early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **“Aha” Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don’t**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb’s Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace’s reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don’t**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors’ successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don’t**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace’s liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

1h87kt3,Carpooling could disrupt the cab industry.,"Carpooling has the potential to eat into the regularized cab industry, but it’s not yet structured or well-backed by tech.

We humans love connecting with qualified strangers, and carpooling can make that possible. Imagine an executive traveling 15 km to their company. Instead of a ride with an unknown driver, they can carpool with a consultant who’s been in the industry for 20-25 years. 

The value of such an exchange is immeasurable—valuable knowledge shared, strong networks built, and a higher level of security compared to rides with drivers from lower strata or remote areas.

To make this a reality, several things need to be fixed:

1.Quick Availability of Drivers: We need a large number of drivers ready to offer rides, ensuring easy availability.

2.Modernized Mobile App: A highly efficient app is key to seamlessly matching users and drivers.

3.Security: Carpooling with qualified professionals provides higher security compared to unknown drivers.

4.Networking Opportunities: It’s not just about getting from point A to B—it’s about building connections and learning from others during the ride.

Carpooling can be the game-changer in our commuting experience. Let’s take it to the next level!",0,startups,1733508338.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h87kt3/carpooling_could_disrupt_the_cab_industry/

1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I’m a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers—just a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we’d never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here’s what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki’s 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you’re a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it’s vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it’s a significant issue worth solving.

I’d follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I’d revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails—no friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* “This investor will drill into your TAM—make sure it’s airtight.”
* “Avoid using the term ‘AI agent’ with these firms.”

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there’s one thing I wish someone had told me: Don’t raise money in the summer.

1h7aic5,My friend's dad passed away and i am trying to help him.,"Hey Reddit, I’m here hoping to get some guidance from this amazing community.

A close friend of mine recently lost his father, and it’s been devastating for their family. His dad was involved in the alco-bev industry for over 20 years, co-running a company with a few partners. He wasn’t the technical guy, and played a key role in sales and relationships.

After his passing, the other founders have been trying to push my friend out of the company. It’s heartbreaking to see him struggle like this, especially since he now has the huge responsibility of providing for his family.

He’s trying to start his own business in the same field, focusing on importing Vatted Malt Spirit (VMS) from Scotland to India. The thing is, he doesn't know much about how this supply chain works or how to even get started. But he wants to continue in this field since his father accumulated a lot of good will in this industry and he kinda wants to continue his father's legacy.

If anyone has experience in the alco-bev industry, especially with Scottish distilleries or international supply chains, I would really appreciate your advice. My friend has lost so much already, and I just want to do everything I can to help him rebuild.

1h7eo7c,PLEASE consider also other pricing options than Subscriptions,"A full time business/start up coach here! I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It’s been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here’s what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it. 

Bad: You’re critiquing humans, basically, so that’s tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends “I needed online dating help so I paid for it”? No customer retention because they’d get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site’s marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We’d review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out. 

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we’d have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it’s income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn’t make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I’m a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about. 

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect. 

It died because: I didn’t pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn’t know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don’t refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to “build a better mouse trap.”

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools. 

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating. 

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself. 

Bad: User acquisition wasn’t easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn’t pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500. 

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property. 

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don’t assume a company’s internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn’t jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales. 

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted…

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like “Vacord Industries, LLC.” and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just “Vacord” so the emails can be more like “Hey Jack, how’s your xyz at Vacord?” Instead of “Hey Jack, how’s xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?”

Good: People said they’d pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out. 

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:  There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again…

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn’t mean you’ll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It’s easier to market than anything else has been, and it’s got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say “I’m really glad we found your tool” is huge to me. 

Bad: It’s a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it’s growing slowly. I’m starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don’t be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you’re wasting your time and money building something that won’t work in the market.

\----

This isn’t even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing €75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

1h6r9vv,First 100 users for my app in a couple of weeks -Lessons learned so far,"It’s incredibly exciting to hit my first 100 users, and I’m especially proud because I did it without any paid advertising! Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You’re Solving** It’s easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else—fundraising, branding, or scaling—comes second to making sure you’re solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I’ve been building this while working a 9–5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You’re More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you’ll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It’s tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup—branding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you’re not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it’s worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always).

1h6iy9o,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what AI can do for your business—if you start today.",2,startups,1733326668.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/

1h5oz6l,The Product-Market-Fit confirmation I could only dream about,"Hey there! I'm solo building my SaaS for more than 2 years now, selling for 13 months already. I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster. 

But most importantly, I know have a strong feeling, I'm building something meaningful.

1h6cqec,Co-Founders or Investors for SMBs,"
I’m a software engineer based in Australia with startup experience—I ran a small company with 5 employees for 3 years and sold it 10 years ago.

I’ve built an AI app, available only on the App Store, for small businesses like plumbers and electricians. The app helps with:

Invoicing: For example, a plumber can say, “Just fixed John Doe's dishwasher, bill him $200,” and it generates the invoice.

Task management and client tracking

Ad campaigns: Users can ask the AI to set up a Facebook ad to find customers nearby.

Website updates: Easily update pricing or services with voice commands.

The app is live but still in early stages. Some people downloaded it, but no one has registered yet. I also need to add key features like ad campaign tools.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I look for co-founders with skills in online ads (like Google or Facebook Ads) or technical expertise to help grow it?

Or should I focus on finding investors so I can hire a dev team and salespeople?

What’s the smarter choice to grow from here? If co-founders are the answer, how do I find the right ones? If it’s investors, where do I start without a user base?

1h6cn1l,"36 startup ideas found by analyzing podcasts (problem, solution &amp; source episode)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains – this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

Here's the latest 36 ideas:

Hope this is useful. If anyone would like to ensure I include any particular podcasts or episodes etc. in future posts, very happy to do so.

I'll generally send \~5 ideas per week in a short weekly digest format (you can see the format I'd usually use in here: podcastmarketwatch.beehiiv.com).

I find it mindblowing that the latest models with large context windows make it even possible to analyze full transcripts at such scale. It's a very exciting time we're living through!

Would love some feedback on this stuff, happy to iterate and improve the analysis/ideas... or create a new newsletter on a different topic if anyone would like.

1h6ar6x,Startup Wisdom: Done is Better Than Perfect,"Hey there, startup enthusiasts and fellow entrepreneurs,

I’ve got some advice to share that’s been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? “Done is better than perfect.” Don’t get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100. Then, based on user feedback, you can decide whether to continue investing in improving the product or to pivot.

Another tip is to create a landing page as soon as possible to start engaging with your users. This helps you gather valuable insights and build a community around your product from the get-go.

If you’re in a situation where you don’t have the coding skills or aren’t sure how to create a landing page, check out my profile.

1h5y72m,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?","So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

Any wise words from the community? Thank you",8,startups,1733260026.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5y72m/validation_by_preselling_before_building_how_to/

1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built? Do you have any advice for me?",62,startups,1733187116.0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5azfu/we_should_have_started_with_a_technical_cofounder/

1h5yefu,"Am I thinking correctly about how to develop an ideal client profile for a tool to help websites deal with bot traffic? 
","We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

Am I missing something here?

Am I thinking about it the right way?

1h5ycm3,P&amp;L Spending Analyzer,"**Pitch:**  
Stealth AI is your personal expense optimizer. It analyzes your P&amp;L, finds cheaper alternatives for every expense, rates the hassle of switching (A+ to F), and delivers monthly reports with actionable savings. It even scours the web and user reviews to ensure smarter spending decisions. Save money without the headaches—effortlessly.

# Why Now?

* **Economic Pressure**: Businesses are facing tighter margins and growing pressure to cut costs amidst economic uncertainty.
* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.
* **Demand for Efficiency**: Companies are increasingly seeking tools to streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize ROI.

# Competition

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don’t actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.
* **DIY Research**: Most businesses rely on manual comparisons and reviews, which is time-consuming and prone to missed opportunities.

**Edge of Stealth AI**: By combining automated expense analysis, real-time pricing from the web, and community insights (e.g., Reddit), Stealth AI creates a unique value proposition that is both cost-effective and proactive—an unmet need in the market.**""**",0,startups,1733260414.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5ycm3/pl_spending_analyzer/

1h5kgil,What Do Startup Founders Look for in a Banking Partner? Your Insights Needed!,"Hi r/startups!

I’m doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I’ve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners—things like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don’t fit founders’ needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts to help shed light on what really matters to founders when choosing a bank.

If you’re a founder, here are a few quick questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	Who do you currently bank with, and why did you choose them?
	2.	What were the most important factors in choosing your bank (e.g., fast onboarding, reputation, digital tools)?
	3.	What’s one thing you wish your banking partner did better?
	4.	At what stage of growth did having a strong banking relationship become critical for your startup?

Feel free to answer any or all of these! Your insights will go into a write-up I’m working on, and I’m happy to share the findings if you’re interested—just let me know in the comments.

I have a survey that would be super helpful to have filled out and takes about 2 min to complete — if you’re open to it, DM me and I’ll send the link :)

1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *“Why not try making my own dream come true?”*. That’s when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *“You’re a lifesaver!”* That’s when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I’ve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It’s been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I’ve started working on another extension for Claude, which I’m hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

Even though the upvotes were low at \~15, the amount of traffic was pretty decent spiking at 1,100 DAU which was amazing. This makes me think 2 things. Firstly, lots of people  were intrigued enough to try the app and didn't really like it so they didn't upvote. But secondly, the DAU dropped today to about 300 today after the launch with plenty of returning users, way more than actually upvoted, which means way more users got value then participated in upvoting on product hunt. 

My question is basically, whats next? My app is somewhat unique in that it requires no account for you to use the app, so I don't have a huge email list (even though I do plan on reaching out to users that actually logged in). The app relies on the user getting enough value out of the product to log in and save their work and also use advanced AI features. That means that I'm really looking to just get as much traffic as possible, hoping for conversions, and eventually monetizing the app?

1h54n5u,Need Advice: Working for a Startup with No Pay (yet) – Stocks vs. Profit Sharing?,"Hey everyone,

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There’s no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We’re not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here’s the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we’ve put into the company. Right now, he’s unable to pay more money because he’s fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states **""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""** which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I’m a software engineer—I can code fast and efficiently—but this feels like uncharted territory.

I’m currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I’m not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I’m skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes, **stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He’s also offered $500–$1000 a month, but I’d honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here’s my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

1h4qvax,Finally starting my journey as a solo SaaS developer 🚀,"Hey everyone,

After 4 years of working as a software dev at a full-time job, I’m finally taking the leap and starting my own SaaS journey. It feels like a big step—exciting, but also a little intimidating to start something on my own.

SaaS has always fascinated me: the idea of building something scalable that solves real problems for people. I’ve worked on plenty of projects over the years—some super exciting, others just routine bug fixing—but I’ve always loved the process of turning raw ideas into something functional and (hopefully) valuable.

Now, I’m diving into it full-time. My plan is to help others—early-stage founders, solo entrepreneurs, or anyone sitting on a SaaS idea—bring their visions to life. I’ll be sharing what I learn, mistakes I make, and hopefully some wins along the way.

If you’ve ever launched (or even thought about launching) a SaaS product, I’d love to hear ur experiences! What worked? What didn’t? What’s one thing you wish you knew when you started?

And if you’ve got an idea you’ve been sitting on for a while but aren’t sure how to get it off the ground, feel free to DM me. I’m always up for chatting about ideas and brainstorming solutions.

I run a fiberglass planter manufacturing business based in India. We specialize in creating high-quality, decorative, and gardening planters.

2. **Connecting with Architects, Interior Designers, and Property Developers**: These professionals are key to the planter market. How do I network with them or make my business more visible to them?
3. **Scaling Domestically**: What operational or marketing approaches should I consider to expand my reach across India?

1h4w1w9,"E-Commerce, My Idea, and Mentors?","Hello All, I am using this as a little bit of a rant and to get some feedback.

I am currently a junior in college. I previously, in highschool and at the start of college, ran an Etsy 3D Printing store. I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea. Over the past 3 years, I have had multiple Venture Capital and Incubator internships, working at some pretty large VCs, one having $500M in AUM. I have learned a lot through these internships, specifically on the deal sourcing side and raising side, and I think I would make a really valuable non-technical founder. I also have gained a really strong network of potential capital raisers, and my dad is a lawyer who works with Startups and Venture Capital firms to raise money.

However, I realize that I need to focus on product, acquiring customers, and proving that there is a demand for my e-commerce platform. I am apprehensive about reaching out to my network of VCs for mentoring/advice in case I want to raise with them in the future. My dad has been really supportive but has more experience in the raising aspect, and I am apprehensive about asking him to leverage his network because I am afraid of ruining his reputation (which is very good in his field/area). I also don't know how to find a technical founder, one who understands e-commerce and 3D printing but also has the skills to develop an e-commerce website.

I would love to hear what you guys would recommend me doing, next steps I can take, or criticisms.",1,startups,1733149365.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4w1w9/ecommerce_my_idea_and_mentors/
1h4vehd,"I’m looking to build an app and I need your help!
","**DISCLAIMER:** *This is not* *a download request, selling, or promotion of the app. This is only a request for your feedback on the IDEA of the app. Is this app something you would like to see become a reality?*

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I’m not sure if it’s something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

**How You Can Help**

What do you think of this idea? Does it sound like something you’d use or recommend to someone? Also, what features would you prioritize in a platform like this? Any feedback or suggestions would be incredibly helpful!

1h4uu0k,What marketing skills are required for joining early startups? ,"Hi :) 

  
I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

I'm in the early stages of building an MVP for my startup, and could really use some advice and encouragement from this amazing community.

A bit about my startup: My company is focused on revolutionizing agricultural trade and beyond. Our vision is to empower smallholder farmers by connecting them with global buyers through a blockchain-integrated web portal.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.
It's been a challenge balancing the development costs while maintaining the momentum of the project.

What I'm looking for:

Advice on getting investors after completing the MVP: For those of you who've been here before, how did you approach investors at this stage? What worked for you?

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting** after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.** Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

1h488p4,Carta Pricing,"I recently looked into Carta's discounts for early-stage tech startups and thought I'd share what I found, in case it's useful to others. If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don’t meet those criteria, you’ll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven’t already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free—Stripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

- Letting users start without an account boosted tutorial completion rates by 10%.  
- Don’t fear the paywall—it’s there for a reason.  
- Nobody reads long explanations—let them dive into the experience instead.  
- Open-ended freedom doesn’t work—guide users with a clear first step.  
- Design and fonts? They matter way more than you think.  

What’s your approach to onboarding? Or in your experience, what sets good onboarding apart from bad?  

I’d love to hear your perspective!",2,startups,1733077803.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h49urb/whats_your_top_priority_for_onboarding_right/
1h42ybs,"5 Years into my Startup Journey: From DJI to COO of a Startup - Reflecting on Growth, Challenges and Seeking Advice","Hey ​guys,

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

Would love to hear your stories and insights.",5,startups,1733058641.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h42ybs/5_years_into_my_startup_journey_from_dji_to_coo/
1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

What do you think of those strategies? Any feedback is welcome.",0,startups,1733086978.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4dgoy/got_a_longterm_idea_for_a_startup_but_currently_0/

1h3lod0,How do I get first users to sign up?,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

1h24jxo,how I learned to sell as a founder (without feeling like a sleazy salesperson),"If you think sales are only for “salespeople,” you’re probably leaving money on the table. After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here’s the truth: sales isn’t about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I’ve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50–100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer’s pain points.
4. **Don’t Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return—like a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you’re not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you’re flying blind.

1hcavv6,Does OpenAI go down too much to take seriously as a production API?,"Right now the OpenAI API, ChatGPT and Sora are completely down.

It's a major outage now at 2 hours 36 minutes and counting. Imagine building a product and just starting to get traction and your product stops working for 2 and a half hours.

We were in the middle of a demo just now and a key component of our app stopped working. Thankfully it didn't affect our demo too much, but it hurts.

I did the math, just looking at their reported uptime for the API alone 99.33%... that's over 2 and a half days of downtime in a year!!

Really putting a fire under us to move to another provider. Let's be real, for most things LLMs are commodities.

How would you all think about this from a supply chain standpoint?",65,startups,1733970321.0,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcavv6/does_openai_go_down_too_much_to_take_seriously_as/
1hcg7nz,Startup Culture,"- Great businesses are all about a great idea.
- Ideas are nothing; it’s all execution. &lt;— we are here.
-  Execution is nothing; it’s resilience.
- Resilience is nothing; it’s timing.
- It’s all just luck.

This pretty much sums up how I feel about startup culture. 

First it was all about the idea, people are obsessed with coming up with the next big thing. Then about execution, and we get bombarded with hustle culture… But then even great execution doesn’t guarantee success. That’s where resilience comes in - sticking with it, pivoting when necessary, and refusing to give up. Except resilience means nothing if you launch a great product at the wrong time.

But then there’s luck. The thing no one wants to admit is that luck.. being in the right place at the right time, connected or rich parents, born in the right location or right time, meeting the right person, or stumbling into the perfect market etc… often plays the biggest role. But books don’t sell the recipe for luck.

Two of these focus on attracting attention, while the third is what truly sets it apart—it solves the core problem. I’ve made significant progress, with the first part about 75% complete.

However, I’m uncertain about when to consider the MVP ready. Should I focus on finishing the first part before moving on to gathering real customer data and using it to refine the MVP and draft a business model? Or should I prioritize something else at this stage? This is all quite new to me, and I’d greatly appreciate any guidance or advice.

1hcpl40,"Ready to run an ad campaign for my vocabulary app, where should I start?","A month ago I launched vocabulary app that lets users explore advanced english words, save ones they want to learn, and then teach themselves the words by taking simple multiple choice quizzes made from example sentences.

The idea is that we learn words by seeing them in context, so there are about 100 example sentences per word allowing the user to get exposure to a bunch of different usages.

It has about 400 downloads, most of which are friends and family + some people from reddit.

I assume I probably won't ever make much money off this app, but I have seen the main Vocabulary app on the App Store have millions of downloads + saw on SensorTower that it generates about $200k per month in revenue. I actually began using this app when I was looking for what my app offers, but honestly was not impressed with the feature offerings.

I'm assuming they probably have pretty high cost on marketing because I see them all over instagram and they come up as the first ad on the app store. Anyways, that makes me think that there is at least decent interest in the ""vocabulary building"" space and a potential to generate some revenue.

This is also my first project and I spent a lot of time on it, so I'm willing to go a few grand in the hole to see if I can get a lot of downloads. If I do, then maybe I could throw some ads on the app or introduce a premium version and paywall some of the features. Idk.

Anyways, would love to get advice on which direction to go.

This is what I'm deciding between:

1. Instagram ads - tooting my own horn here but I think the app has a pretty solid looking UI, so I think the visual nature of instagram lends itself pretty well. Also instagram ads in general seem to be very effective (at least in my personal experience)
2. App store optimization - when I was looking for an app like this I just went to the app store and looked up vocabulary, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Maybe there are other people doing the same thing?
3. Reaching out to vocabulary / dictionary / productivity influencers

I would prefer to only do one of these options and commit 1-2k over the course of a few months. But again I am a total noob to this so if anyone has insight would love to hear it.",2,startups,1734022735.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcpl40/ready_to_run_an_ad_campaign_for_my_vocabulary_app/

1hcp20z,How Do I Gather My First Users for My Deals/Discounts Website?,"Hi everyone,

I launched my website about a month ago—a platform similar to HotUKDeals where users can find deals/discounts and upload their own deals to earn a 25% commission on each sale.

After the launch, I started promoting on social media (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and slowly started building followers (Insta: 55, Facebook: 13, TikTok: 23). Through Google Analytics, I can see some traction—about 300 new visitors weekly—but apart from family, nobody has purchased anything via affiliate links.

I’m passionate about the concept and still believe in its potential. However, I’m struggling to build a critical mass of users. I know that to create a successful platform, I need more users to upload deals, which will lead to more sales, more profit, and, ideally, a positive growth loop.

So far, I’ve tried:
	•	Posting regularly on social media.
	•	Following and engaging with people active on similar platforms.

But growth feels slow, and I’m looking for actionable advice to:
	1.	Drive more traffic to the website.
	2.	Encourage people to upload their own deals.
	3.	Build trust and encourage users to make purchases.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear what worked for you. I’m open to any tips, including unconventional ideas or strategies that might not be immediately obvious.

Happy to share more details about my platform, social media strategy, or analytics if that helps!

|VC|Comments|Overall Score|
|:-|:-|:-|
|fika|Easy to connect and schedule, spoke to an associate who was respectful and intelligent. Did a quick follow up with one of the key partners. The partner meeting looked a bit disengaged and barely asked questions. It seemed he didnt want to be there :) The associate promptly responded in a few days with a respectful reject email citing reasons that seemed genuine. Overall, would still recommend working with them based on the interaction.|8/10|
|Firebolt|The founding partner himself tracked down the startup from a ""VC dark network"". He was persistent. Had 1 call with 2 of the founding partners. They were fully engaged. However, 1 partner who initially reached out seemed to have lost interest half way and started asking annoying questions. Never heard back from them after that 1 call. Total ghosting :)|5/10|
|NextView Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. However, they rescheduled it on the day off the call. When we actually met, the partner disclaimed that they know very little about my space. They asked high level questions. Mid-way through their child walked into the meeting :) I honestly didn't mind it. Kids will be kids! But then the kid got on the nerves of the partner who lashed out their kid right in front of me. Ouch :( The partner was totally distracted from that point on. After a few days they got back promptly citing a legitimate sounding reason.|6/10|
|Ridge Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. The partner was respectful and genuinely interested in learning about the startup. At the same time earnestly raised concerns about my market and it's ability to create winners. They followed up with an investment committe meeting. The meeting invite was awesome. It had the names of the attendees and their backgrounds in good detail so it saved me a ton of time researching each one of them. During the call, all of them were leaning in and genuinely interested in learning about the opportunity. They also challenged certain aspects but did it respectfully. Finally, they promptly followed up but without giving a reason. I requested to give some feedback and the partner setup a call! However, they did a no show on the call :)|9/10|
|SignalFire|They reached out by finding about the startup from the ""VC dark network"". The main contact was very excited after the first call. He followed up with a few questions and then setup a quick follow up with a couple other people. On the second call, the founding partner was suave and respectful. Although he didn't lean in much. A principal was hyper enthusiastic trying to impress his partners by asking awkwardly challenging questions. The main contact responded promptly with a reject and citing specific reasosn which was much appreciated.|9/10|
|Vertex|Call was scheduled promptly through a strong connection. Two partners showed up and both were great to interact with. They were genuinely trying to understand the business and evaluate the opportunity. Through the call it started to emerge that they didn't see it. But despite that they were respectful, cited their initial concerns. They did say that they will get back shortly with a more thoughtful reason. But they ghosted :) At least they were nice on the call!|7/10|
|Weekend Fund|Call was scheduled promptly. The partner was not familiar with the space but leaned in with decent questions. They said they would follow up. There was silence for several days but eventually got back. They claim to be pre-seed but they said they need more traction.|7/10|
|Zero Prime|The junior partner found the deal through the ""VC dark network"". Persisted and eventually we met. He was very enthusiastic and said will quickly follow up with a partner meeting. But then ghosted. No news ever again!|4/10|
|A16Z|Connected to a partner who was from my alma mater. First call was scheduled promptly. They were genuinely interested and asked good questions. They liked the space and the problem being addressed. They promised to follow up shortly. They did follow up citing genuine reasons.|8/10|
|HustleFund|Very frustrating and unclear process. They make you fill out a TypeForm form. Its quite an unwieldy way to fill out long pieces of text. It doesn't save your responses etc. Once I submitted they just sent a reject email in less than 24 hours :D What a fricking waste of time. They logged into the deck but didn't look beyond the title slide. So they didn't really evaluate it. Stay away!|2/10|
|Canaan|Scheduled promptly. Through the meeting didn't really engage and show genuine interest in learning about the statup. They were upfront that they do only companies with traction. So they should have not really even taken the meeting. They said they would get back shortly. But ghosted!!|4/10|
|Unusual Ventures|They were definitely on the bottom of my list. After submitting an online form they very eagerly and promptly setup a meeting based on the teams profiles. During the meeting, they were waiting for one of their main partners who joined late. That partner came totally unprepared and started off with a very condescending tone right of the bat. They were combative right from the beginning and just wanted to play Shark Tank - it seemed like it was entertainment for this partner. I told him that I have already heard that you didn't like this deal and hinted that we don't need to talk any further. Through the back channel later heard that that partner is quite toxic. Stay away!|1/10|
|Boldstart Ventures|Approached them through a warm contact. They didn't take a meeting citing their genuine position on my market - they don't invest in my market. Respect to them for saving everyone's time.|7/10|
|Costanoa|Another one towards the bottom of my list. It was easy to get in touch through a warm intro and the call was scheduled promptly. Two people joined - one was a partner, it wasn't clear what the other person was. This other person was a new member on the firm. They started of asking questions to stump you. There was barely any indication of a genuine effort in understanding the business. The body language was very poor. It felt condescending. They said they would get back in 2 to 4 weeks, but they never got back.|3/10|
|Felicis|The partner scheduled time promptly, asked insighftul questions, gave clarity on next steps. After a few days responded with a thoughtful email citing their reasons. Well done! High points for overall professional engagement.|9/10|
|Array VC|This one was also on the bottom of my list. The partner does not reply to emails promptly. And when they replied they were short half sentence emails - lack of genuine interest/professionalism. They claim they are focused on data &amp; analytics. So I thought they would be genuinely interested. But they didn't go beyond email interactions.|2/10|
|Wing Venture Capital|They comfortably found the link to my deck through the ""VC dark network"", went through it without permission, probably didn't like the deal and never even contacted me. It felt very disrespectful that they just went to the deck though they were not explicitly given access to it. Shady!!|2/10|
|Wave Capital|Conneced through a friend, very nice guy. Thoughtful and attentive. Not a market fit as they are into marketplaces. But still offered to connect to their network.|8/10|
|Afore Capital|In the bottom half of my list. I connected with a partner through a warm connection. But without even responding to me an associate took over. The associate set up a 20 minute meeting!! And for that they showed up 10 minutes late. So after a 15 min evaluation from a recent grad my startup got rejected. Wow! I am sure they spoilt with good deals.|3/10|
|GGV (Notable)|They took the meeting promptly. However, there was not much interest in engaging when they were on the call. They said they would get back, but they never did. Why do their waste their own time (and mine!)|4/10|
|Battery Ventures|They were eager to meet. However, after presenting to them and an engaging discussion, they said they only do series A or later :D Then why did you bother meeting and waste my time :D|6/10|
|Lerer Hippeau|Connected through a friend and was promptly scheduled for a meeting with an associate. The associate was very nice and engaged with inquisitive questions. He set up a follow on with one of the main partners. The main partner, however, was not very engaged he had made up his mind a few minutes into the call that this is not a deal he likes, which is fine. He said he'll get back with some feedback. Couple of days later they got back with some feedback.|8/10|
|Emergent VC|Got connected to them through a friend. The partner requested for updates over email. Sent them all the updates but the partner never even replied to the email. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Ovo Ventures|Easy to schedule with them, met them through a warm connection. The partner met and asked great questions and it was a good lively discussion. They did make it clear what the concerns were during the meeting. And then very promptly followed back, citing their reasons honestly. Very respecttful &amp; professional!|9/10|
|Kearney Jackson|Met them through a warm connection and the meeting was set up pretty quickly. Both the partners showed up and engaged very actively asked great questions. It felt like I learned something. They got back promptly, giving genuine reasons. Very professional great performance would work with them .|9/10|
|Nexus|Met them through a warm connection and a meeting was set up promptly. The partner was very curious and fully engaged. The meeting was in person. After going through the business, he was upfront that he didn't see a good market opportunity. But was classy in the way he said that. He did say he would follow up, but he never did.|7/10|
|Lightspeed Venture Partners|This was again through a warm connection and the meeting was set up promptly. The partner was engaged, although it wasn't clear how much he really understood. He did ask for some time to evaluate the business. He got back after a few days in a professional manner. No real complaints but wasn't impressive.|7/10|
|Montavista|I sent an email directly to the main partner who is from the same alma matter as me. They responded quickly and scheduled  time for an in person meeting along with the partnership. Everybody showed up on time. They had six people on the call. Three in the room with me and three on a Zoom call. Couple of them has great genuine questions and wanted to understand the opportunity. However, one person was very annoying, trying to put me down several times. It seemed they were trying to justify their value to the partnership by saying things like ""I can connect you with this big guy or that big guy"". The main partner, however, was awesome. He got back promptly citing his reasons for rejection.|7/10|
|Altos Ventures|Met the partner through a warm referral. They suggested an in person meeting. However, they don't have any parking around there which made it stressful. Also, it was far away from where I live so it was too much time commitment. And what made it more annoying was that within the first two minutes we established that they don't do preseed and seed stage investments. I wish they had just done a zoom call before an in-person. To their credit the partner was very nice and we had a good debate around the pros and cons of my startup strategy.|6/10|
|ENIAC VC|Got an intro into the firm from a warm referral. However, the email responses were very slow and when they did respond, the scheduler did not set up a meeting. I had to send a reminder to get the meeting scheduled. The partner who I met with did not really lean in. They said they would get back with next steps, but never did. Ghosted!|4/10|
|Foundation Capital|Got connected to them through a warm referral. In fact, foundation wanted to meet with me. However, when we connected they scheduled a meeting three weeks out! And on the day of the meeting, they rescheduled it. And then on the day of the meeting, the partner said that they would be taking the call on voice while driving. The audio was terrible. During the meeting, the partner was condescending. The saving grace was that the partner was smart and direct which I totally appreciate. But they were disrespectful which I totally don't appreciate.|4/10|
|Peak XV|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled two weeks out! When we met, one partner was still driving to work and the other partner was running behind. They did engage actively and showed genuine interest in the problem space. They said they would evaluate the market and get back for next steps. But I never heard back. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Village Global|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled promptly. I had to reschedule the first meeting because of an emergency. But the partner was very respectful and promptly accepted the reschedule. When we met, we established that they are from my industry. That really made the conversation engaging and meaningful. They got the idea! They followed back with very good questions. They also set clear expectations about the timeline for a decision.|8/10|
|Swift Ventures|They reached out to me by finding about me through the ""VC dark network"". The meeting was set up promptly, and one of the main partners attended. The discussion was decent. The partner was humble. But knew very little about my space. I thought it was a no-go I did not bother to follow up. But they followed up a few days later asking for my deck to have a clear closure. I sent the deck and a few hours later they got back stating their reasons for not going through.

1hci1oy,Freelance/Task Platform MVP Without an Escrow System?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice from entrepreneurs, developers, and experts who’ve worked on building platforms or MVPs.

I’m based in Ethiopia, where platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit have a huge untapped market but also face unique barriers. My goal is to create a platform tailored to my country, solving challenges like:

Payment Systems: Most Ethiopians don’t have access to international payment platforms like PayPal.

Language Barrier: Many don’t speak fluent English to navigate these global platforms.

Task Complexity: Many tasks on these platforms require high-level skills. I want to focus on simple, delegatable tasks, both digital and physical.


My Plan

I’m starting small with an MVP to validate the idea. Initially, I planned to use a Telegram bot interlinked with channels to mimic the platform experience. The idea was:

Users could find and post tasks for free (no commissions).

The bot would handle task assignments and communication.

Tasks would be split into digital (simple remote tasks like trimming videos or translating text) and physical (local jobs like delivering items or assembling furniture).


However, I hit a major roadblock:
I need an escrow system to build trust between users. But to integrate with Ethiopia’s banking system, I’d need:

A registered business

A trade license

A physical office, etc.


This requires upfront money (~$2000), which I don’t have.

My Question

How can I build an MVP that attracts users without an escrow system?

Are there ways to create trust and security without formal escrow?

Can I simplify the platform further to avoid needing banking integration?

Should I pivot to a different MVP idea that requires fewer resources?


I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. If anyone has tackled similar challenges, your advice would be invaluable.

Thank you!",2,startups,1733998592.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hci1oy/freelancetask_platform_mvp_without_an_escrow/

1hbxxpd,How I run customer interviews (and why they're better than analytics for 0-1),"## Why talk to customers?

Look, I've built products at companies of all sizes - tiny startups, growing scale-ups, and 500-person enterprises. The one thing that's always worked? Actually talking to customers. Especially when you're starting from scratch.

Don't get me wrong - tools like Amplitude are great at showing you what people do in your app. But they miss everything that happens outside it. Some of the best insights I've found came from discovering that people were using weird Excel templates or Word docs as workarounds. You'd never catch that in your analytics.

## Getting good at interviews isn't hard

A lot of people get nervous about customer interviews. I get it - talking to strangers can be awkward. But honestly? It comes down to a few simple techniques that anyone can learn. Here's what works for me when I'm trying to understand customer problems.

## The techniques that actually work

### Ask questions that let people ramble

The best insights come when you let people tell their stories. Instead of asking ""Do you use Excel for this?"" (which just gets you a yes/no), ask ""How do you handle this today?"" Then shut up and listen.

### Repeat stuff back to them

This one's surprisingly powerful. When someone spends five minutes explaining their process, just summarize it back: ""So what you're saying is...?""

Two things happen:
1. If you misunderstood something (which happens all the time), they'll correct you
2. They often remember important details they forgot to mention

### Go down rabbit holes

Some of the best stuff comes from completely random tangents. When someone mentions something interesting, keep pulling that thread. Keep asking why. I've had calls where we went totally off-topic and found way bigger problems than what we originally wanted to talk about.

## How to run the actual call

### First five minutes

I always start the same way:

""Hey, thanks for jumping on. We've got 30 minutes - that still work for you? Cool. I wanted to talk about [topic]. You might have other stuff you want to ask about, but let's save that for the end if we have time. That sound okay?""

Simple, but it:
- Makes sure they're not running off to another meeting in 10 minutes
- Keeps things focused
- Lets them know they'll get to ask their questions too

### Diving into the conversation

Here's the thing about good interviews - they should feel like natural conversations, not interrogations. Start as wide as possible. I usually kick off with something super open-ended like ""Tell me about how you handle [whatever process] today.""

Then just listen. Like, really listen. When they mention something interesting, that's your cue to dig deeper. Say they mention ""Yeah, it's frustrating because I have to copy stuff between systems."" Don't just note that down and move on. That's gold! Follow up with ""Tell me more about that. What are you copying? Where from? Where to?""

The best stuff often comes from these diving-deeper moments. Maybe you'll discover they spend two hours every Friday copying data from their ticketing system into Excel because the reporting sucks. That's the kind of insight you can actually do something with.

Sometimes the conversation will hit a natural lull. That's when you pull from your question bank. But don't rush to fill every silence. Some of the best insights come right after those slightly awkward pauses when people remember ""Oh yeah, and there's this other thing that drives me crazy...""

### Questions I keep handy

Instead of a strict script, I keep a list of reliable questions I can throw in when needed:

- ""How do you deal with this right now?""
- ""On a scale of 1-10, how annoying is this problem?""
- ""What's an even bigger pain in your day?""
- ""Tell me about the last time this came up""
- ""Do you use any other tools for this? Excel? Word?""
- ""If you could wave a magic wand, how would this work?""

Don't treat these like a checklist. They're just there for when the conversation hits a wall or you need to dig deeper into something interesting.

### How to keep it flowing

1. Start really broad. Let them talk about their day, their problems, whatever's on their mind.

2. When they mention something painful, dig into it.

3. Sometimes asking about the same thing different ways helps. People might not realize they're using a workaround until you specifically mention spreadsheets or sticky notes.

4. Save the ""magic wand"" question for last. By then they've thought through all their problems and can better imagine solutions.

## Stuff that kills good interviews

1. **Asking leading questions**: Don't say ""Wouldn't it be better if..."" Just ask ""How would you improve this?""

2. **Trying to sell**: You're there to learn, not pitch. Save the product talk.

3. **Sticking too hard to your questions**: If they start talking about something interesting, follow that instead.

4. **Not recording**: Always ask if you can record. You'll miss stuff in your notes, and sometimes you need to hear exactly how they said something.

## Why this matters

Here's the thing: Analytics can tell you what users do, but only interviews tell you why. The best products I've worked on started with stuff I never would have found in analytics. They came from actual conversations where I shut up and let people tell me about their weird workarounds and daily frustrations.

Sure, it takes time. Yes, it can be awkward. But it works better than anything else I've tried.",41,startups,1733935901.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbxxpd/how_i_run_customer_interviews_and_why_theyre/

1hcfpwh,Turning a Dream into Reality: Seeking Support to Empower Thousands in Ethiopia,"Hi everyone,

I’m a dreamer from Ethiopia, a country where opportunities are hard to come by, but dreams still thrive. I’m working on building something that could change lives—not just mine, but countless others in my community. It’s a platform that seamlessly connects task creators with task doers. Imagine waking up stressed about money, without a job, or being a student needing quick income. My platform would let anyone with a laptop or phone find simple, quick tasks they can complete remotely—whether it’s a 2-hour gig or a one-day job. No hassle, no stress, just a way to make legitimate money right from your bed.

This isn’t just a website to me; it’s my passion and my purpose. I want to create a credible, seamless, and addictive platform that gives people a chance to thrive. For many here, $2,000 might not seem like much, but in Ethiopia, it’s a fortune. It’s the one barrier stopping me from making this vision a reality.

Sadly, platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter don’t work in my region, and finding funding locally is almost impossible. So, I’m reaching out directly to anyone out there who believes in the power of ideas and the impact one person can make. I know this idea has the potential to transform lives, to take people from feeling stuck to feeling empowered.

If you’ve ever had a dream you believed in with your whole heart but just didn’t have the resources to bring it to life, you know how I feel. I need $2,000 to get started, and I promise this isn’t just about me. It’s about building a system that helps people in my country find dignity, opportunity, and hope in the simplest way.

If you can support me or even share this message, you’re not just helping me; you’re becoming part of a journey to create something bigger than both of us. One person’s trash is another person’s gold, and this dream is my gold.

1hc01id,Product and Message Differentiation is everything. Here's how I find both ,"**Introduction:** 

Great messaging is essential. Your message is the first thing anyone hears, reads, or sees about your business. It’s your elevator pitch, business card, tagline, and more all rolled into one.

Differentiated messaging — the only kind that really matters — is even more important. It not only conveys who you are, but who your target customers are and how you help them in a way your competitors can’t.

If done well, differentiated messaging helps every part of your organization level up:

* **Marketing** understands *who* you want to reach and *how* your company alone can help them. The team writes better copy, creates more effective campaigns, and builds an inbound machine filled with great prospects.
* **Sales** understands marketing’s *who* and *how*, but is also armed with a cheat code that helps them thrive in any competitive conversation they encounter.
* **Product** gets a clearer understanding of your advantage in the eyes of your customers (as opposed to their minds) and doubles down on what buyers care about most and can make smart investment and roadmap decisions.

Without a solid differentiated foundation, you and your teams suffer from:

* **Confusion**: What exactly does your company offer that’s special and why do customers care?
* **Low-confidence:** How do we talk about our product and business? Are these campaigns and talk tracks likely to work? What do we build? Who do we pursue?
* **Second-guessing and bad suggestions:** Without doing the hard work of figuring out how you're unique and valuable (i.e. differentiated), every mediocre idea gets considered, every good idea is prone to second-guessing. You waste time, energy, and enthusiasm.

You need to do the work to set a foundation and execute.

The good news: None of the above is that difficult to overcome. With a little knowledge of your competitors, product, and customers, you can create great differentiated messaging. 

All it takes is the right framework and some time.

**A few useful definitions:** 

* **Differentiator:**A characteristic of your firm that separates you from key competitors and gives you a perceived advantage in the eyes of your target customers
   * Key Elements: 
      * Entire firm, not just the product
      * Key competitors, not every competitor
      * Customer focus  
* **Messaging:**The key concepts you want a prospect to know about your company. What do you provide? How do you provide it? What value do customers receive? Messaging is the foundation that supports effective marketing, copywriting, campaigns, sales conversations, and more.  
* **Differentiated Messaging:**This is the unique message and story that only you can tell because of the product and company you’ve built and customers you serve. It tells prospects how you’re uniquely valuable to them and how you alone can help achieve a particular outcome. Differentiated messaging should be your marketing team’s holy grail and first priority before writing a website, one-pager, case study, or any other piece of collateral.

**Step 1: Get Smart**

You’re going to have a very hard time telling a compelling story about your business if you don’t understand your product, customers, and competitors, which are the Core Components of Differentiated Messaging.Founders *sometimes* know their product, customers, and competitors well enough to proceed straight to Step 2, but there are plenty of founders who have understandably confused themselves about who they serve well and why. They’re too in the weeds to be effective marketers. 

Other leaders — CMOs, sales and product leaders, and product marketers — will need to partner across teams to make sure they’ve got the requisite knowledge to have a fruitful discussion.The idea is to know each of the Core Components as a team. A single individual doesn’t need all of this knowledge, but across a team, you need to know product, customers, and competitors. 

In general you should know (or get to know) your:

* Customers: 
   * Firmographics: What types of businesses have you sold to in the past? Consider industry, team size and composition, revenue, geography, tech stack, and customer base. This will help you develop a hypothesis about which potential segments you serve best.
   * Buyers: Who within a firm do you sell to most often? What persona? Who else is in the buyer map?
   * Problems: What problems are the companies you serve facing? What are they trying to accomplish?
   * Why you: The most difficult question to answer accurately is why customers chose you. Your sales conversations should give you an idea about why a customer chose you, but you may need to circle back and ask again. A decent win-loss program really helps here.

* Product: 
   * Features: You may have a technical product with a long list of features. It’s possible that 1-2 of these are a key differentiator.
   * Non-Product Attributes: While we tend to focus on features in technology, it’s likely that your customers value some other aspect of your firm. The sales experience, delivery channel, customer service, industry expertise, and more are all possible differentiation factors. So while the product gets the most attention, be sure to think beyond the software.  
* Competitors: 
   * It’s easy to go too deep on your competitors. You can easily consider too many competitors and think too much about their features, customers, investors, marketing and more. Instead, focus on the three competitors you see most often in deals, and focus on their marketing. Limit your research here competitors’ websites and five most recent blog posts and press releases. You’ll need to consume this marketing with a critical eye. Look for what they’re saying and *what they’re not saying*.

**Step 2: Structured Workshop With Your Team**

This is the crux.

Of the three steps, this workshop is the one that has the biggest potential impact. If done well you’ll surface useful disagreements, compelling insights, unique perspectives, and come to consensus on what matters most. It uncovers facts, drives alignment, and helps win buy-in, all of which are keys to a successful messaging project.

I use a framework called MUD, which I learned from a very smart colleague. MUD is an acronym for:

* Meaningful: Can we charge money for this attribute?
* Unique: Do we alone offer it? Can our target customers get the same thing elsewhere?
* Defensible: Can we prove what we claim with data or testimonials?

Here’s the workshop process:

1. **Discuss potential differentiators as a group**This isn’t quite a brainstorm, but it is a broad discussion about your business and customers. You want to encourage people to consider the business broadly and think beyond mere product features — remember the elements of a differentiator in the definition above.You’ll notice the same ideas surfacing again and again from slightly different angles, with slightly different emphases. That’s great! Let the ideas and opinions flow during this portion of the discussion. That said, it’s helpful if you can combine similar ideas to points that have already been made, as it makes subsequent steps easier. An experienced facilitator can really help here.Depending on your product and market, you should generate a list of 10-30 potential differentiators.  
2. **Evaluate based on MUD**With a list of 20-30 potential differentiators in hand, you then evaluate them based on the MUD framework.Go down your list and ask yourselves if each is Meaningful (will someone pay for this attribute), Unique (you alone offer it), and Defensible (can you prove it). Be very honest. The temptation to fudge is strong, especially when you’re discussing Uniqueness, but being soft here will hurt in the long run. Again, an experienced facilitator can help you navigate tough questions and commit to ideas with promise.The MUD process should hone your imprecise list of 20-30 potential differentiators down to 3-5 well-articulated, high-quality attributes that you can share confidently with your team, prospects, and customers.

**Step 3: Refine results to craft a compelling story**

A workshop alone won’t lead to clear and compelling differentiators. You’ll need a team of articulate colleagues to make your differentiators shine and to highlight the value that each delivers. Spend time with a colleague or two to refine what you created in the workshop and highlight the value each delivers for your target customers.You should seek to use each of your differentiators as a pillar that supports a compelling story about your customer, product, and market. And that story should lead customers directly to one solution … yours.

1hbsxn7,Are you pivoting after a negative pitch?,"Hi all,

so my co founder and me (I am the IT guy) just had our first real pitch to a potential pilot customer. We are working on a platform where users are able to buy services. The niche is not very digital yet. 
So we presented our idea and he said that it will not work because they will always use the payment and redemption options in their existing POS provider. They are also working on some local apps to have it more digital and don't need an overall platform, because we will not be able to onboard all other businesses. 
So we are asking ourselves now if we need to pivot on some main features or not. Our app will be much better for the enduser, but if we don't have businesses on our platform it will not help. An integration to the POS systems would be great, but to expensive at the beginning. We wanted to handle the payments here and redeem the products via QR Codes in the beginning. I still think we have a great solution, but he said we should change the area for our business.

So are you pivoting some features after every feedback or do you evaluate the feedback and then continue working on the general product? 

Thanks,

1hbrl60,3 Key Elements of a High-Converting Web App MVP 🚀,"As someone who builds MVPs as a part of my daily job, I’ve learned a lot about what works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to creating impactful web applications. Here are three things I always keep in mind:

1️⃣ **Simplicity is Key:** Your MVP isn’t meant to be feature-packed. Focus on the **core problem** you’re solving and implement just enough functionality to validate your idea. Adding too many features early can overwhelm users and delay launch.

2️⃣ **User Feedback Drives Growth:** The first version isn’t perfect—and it shouldn’t be. Launch early, then use **real feedback from users** to guide the next steps. Tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics can help you understand user behavior.

3️⃣ **Landing Pages Matter:** Your app is only half the battle. A clear, well-designed landing page with strong CTAs can significantly improve conversions. Highlight the benefits over features, and keep the design clean to avoid cognitive overload. A Good looking landing page &amp; a high conversion landing page are two diff things.

If you’re a founder working on an idea or struggling with getting your MVP to market, feel free to share your challenges in the comments. I’d be happy to brainstorm ideas or offer advice. Let’s help each other build something great!

1hbz0xm,Worth Building this SAAS?,"I'm working on a SAAS which takes your content and localizes it, this includes translation with lipsyncing, using your own voice for dubbing etc.. as well as channel creation and automatic uploading. So you can link your youtube channel, select ""Spanish"" and the channel will be created and automatically go through the localization and uploading process every time you upload to your main channel, hence expanding your viewership/brand/revenue.

This will be available for Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter etc..

The main pushback against this is product is that Youtube is starting to add an ""Audio Track"" setting that enables automatic dubbing for your channel. The problem with relying solely on this Youtube feature for localization is that

1. It's being rolled out slowly and only available for a small amount of creators.
2. Even when dubbing is added it's unnatural because of the unsynced lips
3. Dubbing takes away the personal connection you create with your actual voice/brand recognition and uses a generic sound that is probably assigned to every other channel.
4. This may be incorrect but I've read that mixing your channel demographics from different countries can lower the ad rates for US based channels which have the highest rate. So if users start watching dubbed spanish and your main user base starts to shift from the US to say Brazil, then the revenue you generate will start decreasing opposed to keeping a purely US based rate.
5. While other platforms may start to push out dubbing sometime soon, right now only Youtube has just started to do it and trying to implement the other features such as using your own voice for dubbing at the scale Youtube has to deal with will be nearly impossible for a long time.

1hbkqyi,Llama is better? My client insists on Claude for building an AI Agent,"I’m working on a project where I need to build an AI agent for a client. As someone who has evaluated different models, I genuinely believe LLaMA (especially its recent iterations) is better for the job. Here’s why:
	1.	Customization: LLaMA is open-weight, which means I have far greater flexibility to fine-tune and tailor it for the specific use case. This level of control is perfect for creating a specialized agent.
	2.	Cost-Efficiency: Hosting LLaMA locally or on dedicated infrastructure can save significantly in the long term compared to relying on Claude’s API pricing structure.
	3.	Performance: Depending on the task, LLaMA has shown better accuracy and reasoning capabilities in many benchmarks. It also has a more robust architecture for handling nuanced instructions when properly fine-tuned.
	4.	Privacy: Since LLaMA can run on custom infrastructure, I can ensure data security and privacy, which is a big concern for many businesses these days.

However, my client is adamant about using Claude. I get it—it’s user-friendly, has a solid API, and works great out of the box for many general-purpose applications. But I feel like Claude’s closed ecosystem and less customizable nature might limit the long-term potential of the AI agent we’re building.

Am I wrong for pushing back on this? Has anyone else faced a similar situation where the client insists on a tool that you know isn’t the best fit? Would love to hear your thoughts on navigating this!

1hbbna8,Marketing organically is insanely hard and burning me out,"UK-based

I have a tech background and have blasted through building an MVP/prototype that shows off my idea concept, it took about 5 weeks. I'm trying to build interest and 75% of the time people respond positively (if they reply),  A handful of people have reached out asking to try it free of charge and but I haven't received any feedback yet. I have been reaching out to people via LinkedIn private messaging and reddit forums.

My idea is healthcare-related and I get the impression that many people in the industry are just overworked and don't have time nor motivation to try out my solution. They need an incentive, I am basically saying ""*hey, I made a thing, please can you try it for me AND let me know what you think for free???*"", it is a shock to me that people are even saying yes to this.

I don't know how to give that incentive to them without scaling the product, but then it would be foolish to scale a product that hasn't been validated, no?

I am currently unemployed and working on this full time and the lack of traction I am getting from marketing has been way more frustrating than I expected - when I was building I felt total control over how fast the project was moving and more alive than ever. Now I feel like I am frozen, and I am beating myself up over what feels like a huge lack of progress.

I would love some guidance, are there any angles I can take here? I have budget for advertising, I was thinking that I could create a landing page to gauge interest and then email the people who sign up personally instead of hoping they'll get back to me.

1hbux45,I’ve built an AI website builder and it’s free to use,"
So, at the start of this year, I had the idea to develop a free website builder for small business owners using Al, saving them months of stress and thousands in design costs.

Brands such as Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace are great, but they still required a certain level of skill to use and also took a decent amount of time to complete a website. We realised most business owners don't have this time and definitely didn't want to spend thousands on a new website. 

Our mission was to put an end on this completely.

So, we developed an AI website builder which we believe is the best in the market (after testing and paying attention to others)

Here’s how the platform works:
- AI does the heavy lifting: use it to design unlimited amounts of websites in seconds, or choose from 200+ professionally designed templates. 
- Not confident with tech? No worries, you can schedule a free 1-on-1 website setup call where we’ll design the website for you. (Basically, you’re getting a free web designer- no stress or hidden fees)
- Plus, our websites are easy to manage, you can do any updates yourself, anytime, without paying a penny more. And we have an online course with answers to all topics. 

This AI website builder has been developed all year and we’re now wanting more people to test it out for themselves, and to also gauge the interest from people - although we did reach 6K followers from pre launch ads! (Humble brag)

Right now, we’re working with service based businesses only, as we don’t want to burden ourselves with e-commerce functionality at the start, although we do have this as an option, it just requires some extra coding.

If you’re wondering how we’re offering this service for free, our platform offers website hosting and we also have a marketing agency so developing these connections will only help us work with the next big upcoming businesses. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
- Does this sound like something you or a small business owner you know would use?
- What features would make a platform like this a no brainer for you?
- Any feedback on the concept or launch strategy?

If you’re curious to see how it works, just drop me a message - happy to arrange a call or I can share the website if you want to test it out for yourself.

Looking forward to your thoughts and advice! I’m here to learn from the community and improve where I can. ",0,startups,1733928027.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbux45/ive_built_an_ai_website_builder_and_its_free_to/

We're a B2C startup that just surpassed $12k MRR, bootstrapped, and we're also doing a spinoff - a B2B product that grew from a personal pain point we experienced while growing our B2C business through SEO. We have some early traction with B2B, but B2C remains our primary source of revenue.

We've also raised a very small FFF round to accelerate our growth. We're a very small team at the moment, just two brothers as co-founders. I'm the CEO/CTO, technical, write code and sell, with lots of experience from working at YC and big tech. My brother is non-technical, a CPO/CMO blend, responsible for marketing, product, operations, and customer support. We also have two hired people: a content marketer and a software engineer.

Our blind spots are structure, project management, and strategy. We all hate routine and project management. I feel a need for someone to step into a role to help us ""get organized.""

A friend of mine organically approached us and made himself useful on several fronts. He helped us think through our goals and financial projections. He's really good with data, holds a PhD in computer science, but he's more of a Data Science person. We also get along very well (I've known him for 10 years now but never worked on any substantial project together). He's also remote. I'm in SF, my brother's in Warsaw, and he's in Amsterdam.

Now we want to make a decision about whether to make him an offer as a co-founder. Help me think this through. Here are the questions I've asked myself so far:

1. Would this person increase the probability of success for this company? Yes, I think he will. But maybe if I looked more intentionally, I'd find someone who would accelerate us even faster. I'm not sure.
2. Can I hire this person? No, I can't. His salary is north of $300k yearly, and we wouldn't be able to afford that.
3. Are his skills complementary to ours? Yes, he has much better presentation skills than anyone in our group. He also has a PhD, which looks good on paper and will attract better talent.
4. Do we get along? Yes, I feel comfortable in his presence and would love to hang out together.

His role would be something like chief of staff, plus he could help with engineering.

Now, I know this is a lot of words, but what questions should I ask myself before making him a co-founder or deciding otherwise?",3,startups,1733865216.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbch7r/do_we_need_a_cofounder_or_an_employee/
1hb7bu8,Should I Quit My Job to Pursue My Startup Idea?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads and could really use some advice. I work as an staff applied research scientist in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and during my job, I’ve identified a significant problem in the process of data generation for RAG systems. I’ve come up with an idea that I believe can solve this problem effectively—not just for my current company but for any organization that relies on document-based systems.

Here’s the situation:
- The idea is not specific to my company; it’s a general solution that could benefit various industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.

- I haven’t built anything yet, but I’ve started planning the product and am confident it could work.

- My current employment contract likely restricts me from working on side projects without disclosure.

I’m torn between two options:
- Stay at my job and work on the idea as a side project: This would allow me to validate the idea without taking a big financial risk. However, it feels slow, and I’m concerned about any potential conflict with my employer.

- Quit my job and go all-in on the startup: This would give me the freedom to focus entirely on the idea, but it’s a big leap, and I’d need to rely on my savings until the startup gains traction.

For context:
- I have savings to support myself (single no kids) for a 1 year.

- I’m passionate about solving this problem and feel this idea has real potential.

- I want to act ethically and ensure I’m not violating any legal agreements.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I quit my job and take the risk, or try to balance both until the idea gains traction?

* **Small Budget**: Less than $3,300 per month (\~$100/day).
* **Tiny Budget**: Less than $600 per month (\~$20/day).

Starting small is wise because initial campaigns might not perform well. Once profitable, you can scale confidently.

# 1. Copy What Works Best in Your Industry

With limited funds, avoid testing too many variables. Instead:

* Use the **Meta Ads Library** (free tool) to analyze competitors' ads.
* Focus on ads that have been running for months; these are likely successful.
* Model your ads on these examples, including style, format, and language, but avoid outright copying.

Shortcut your success by leveraging others' testing efforts.

# 2. Reduce the Number of Variables

* Focus on selling **one product or service** at a time, preferably:
   * Your best-selling item.
   * The item with the highest profit margin.
* Keep campaigns simple with fewer ad sets and ads.

This approach helps Meta gather sufficient data and optimizes performance faster.

# 3. Trust Meta’s Algorithms

Rely on tools like **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns** or **Advantage+ Audiences** to let Meta optimize targeting and placement. Avoid experimental tactics that could risk your small budget.

Meta’s systems are designed to deliver results, especially when campaigns align with platform recommendations.

# 4. Be Willing to Spend More on Conversions

Set realistic expectations for return on ad spend (ROAS):

* For beginners, aiming for a **2x–4x ROAS** is reasonable.
* Aggressively spend up to your break-even point to gain initial customers.

The goal is not immediate profitability but scaling, gathering conversion data, and building brand awareness for long-term success.

# 5. Avoid Brand Awareness Campaigns

For small budgets:

* Focus on **lead generation** or **sales campaigns**.
* Avoid vague objectives like ""getting your business out there.""

Exception: **Omnipresent content strategies** can work for small audiences but are niche-specific.

# 6. Avoid Constantly Tweaking Campaigns

Frequent adjustments reset the **learning phase**, hindering optimization. To maximize success:

* Allow campaigns to run for a sufficient period to gather data.
* Adjust based on **conversion volume**, not arbitrary timeframes.

Smaller budgets mean longer learning phases, so patience is key.

# 7. Niche Down Your Audience

Target a specific subsection of your market to:

* Tailor messaging effectively.
* Stand out from generic ads targeting broad audiences.

For example, instead of marketing broadly, position yourself as a specialist in a specific industry, like SaaS businesses. Expand gradually as you scale.

# 8. Embrace New Features and Strategies

Leverage your small business agility by quickly adopting:

* New Meta features.
* Innovative ad strategies.

Larger companies often move slower due to complex decision-making processes, giving smaller advertisers a competitive advantage.

# Conclusion

Running Facebook ads with a small budget requires strategic planning and patience. By focusing on what works, trusting Meta’s tools, and avoiding common pitfalls, you can achieve success and scale your campaigns over time. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your results grow.",0,startups,1733899607.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbnnwg/how_to_crush_facebook_ads_with_a_small_budget/
1hbsldk,this is how i got 15k signups in 24hrs ,"i made a post 3 months ago about an idea i had last year around and how it received traction of 13k in the waitlist but failed to build a team and raise to get it going. well in the past 24 hrs, i got another project **100k visits, 80k submissions, 15k signups, and 24k affiliate clicks in 24 hrs** on a pretty basic idea. im not here to promote the product or the project but talk about marketing and execution as whole especially with $0 marketing budget. we would be breaking even in the end, mby slight profit but it was never meant to be a money maker, more so marketing project to bring ppl to the platform.

my cofounder and i are 2-man team. he is the tech and i am the marketing/growth. i came up with the idea last week, pitched it to him, he built it in 2 days, and we dropped it. no posts on reddit, no paid ads, no influencers or creators, just by asking and making friends. our goal for this specific project is to grow and build a community around it. it aint gonna make us millions but what's valuable is the platform and users we'll be able to reach.

here are few tips to tech founders who lack marketing and sales:

\- build a brand or build a persona online but have a presence

\- interact with soon to be users/customers ahead of time but don't give off corporate/sales vibes, make friends

\- build relationships with your users ahead of time, months ahead ideally but weeks works.

\- always ask, the worst thing a person can say is ""no"", don't be afraid of rejection or being ignored or ghosted

these tips would be your generic tips for any startup, depending on the industry and audience, u'd have to think outside the box.

1hbn3hx,Idea Validation - Ever spent hours wrestling with data from a PDF or invoice? ,"You know the drill: someone sends you a file, and suddenly it’s *your job* to extract all the data manually. Copy-pasting, fixing formatting issues, and double-checking everything. By the time you’re done, you’re wondering why it felt like such a monumental waste of time.

I’ve been there. And honestly? It’s what inspired me to start building a solution.

Here’s the idea:  
Imagine a tool where you can upload *any* document—PDFs, invoices, contracts, whatever—and it extracts all the important data into a clean, editable table in seconds no OCR training effort required, you just tell what you want to extract regardless of the format and it does it for you.

But that’s not all. You could:

* Edit or add custom notes/fields right there.
* Automate the next steps (send data to your CRM, shoot off an email, etc.).
* Validate data through a custom API or save it directly into your database.

Basically, it’s about turning that painful grunt work into an automated workflow. No coding. No headaches. Just fast, clean data you can actually use.

Now, I would like to validate the idea, how do you guys feel about this?

1hbdfhb,5 ways content marketing has changed over the last decade,"I've been in the digital marketing game since 2010, mostly focusing on startups and e-commerce. As I've been prepping to launch a new project, it’s striking just how much the industry has changed over the last decade—and how few of the tactics I would have employed in 2015 are even remotely relevant today.

And since one of my core marketing skills has always been wasting time on Reddit, I thought I’d put some of my thoughts together in a post to see if this tracks with other folks’ experiences.

Here are five ways I’ve seen content marketing evolve over the last decade. What did I miss?

**1. Organic social reach for written content has collapsed**

One of the first startups I worked with built a sizable audience on Facebook simply by creating and sharing fun, engaging blog content. At its peak, this company could post an intriguing blog link and consistently count on tens of thousands of clicks without spending any money on boosting it at all. This was the era of BuzzFeed quizzes, endless listicles, and content designed—for better or worse— to appease the clickbait gods.

But in the mid-to-late 2010s, Facebook introduced changes that completely killed this strategy. Organic reach for links was throttled, while content that kept users on the platform (like videos and native posts) was rewarded. Look up the infamous “pivot to video” for an illustration of how this impacted media brands. For more check out Cory Doctorow’s concept of “enshittification,” a pattern that continues to today.

**2. SEO Is more competitive, niche, and less gameable**

When I first started in marketing, the SEO playbook was riddled with black-hat tactics: keyword stuffing, low-effort link farms, duplicate sites—you name it. But then Google got hip and rolled out a series of algorithm updates that penalized low-quality tactics. Some clients I worked with lost half their SEO traffic overnight as various core algo updates rolled out.

Since then, Google has continued to bang the drum that all it wants is high-quality, useful content that fills the needs of the person searching. Of course, this is not a bad thing, and in-depth, original, and niche content that truly addresses search intent should be rewarded. What's challenging is that over this same period, it's become increasingly difficult to ""win"" at SEO as Google has stuffed its SERPs with ads and new features like those recent AI summaries. SEO remains one of the only viable content channels for startups, but in many ways, it's more competitive and more difficult than ever.

**3. Mobile-first everything**

Even the most professional UX designers (working as they do from their 27-inch monitors) can forget that most web traffic comes from mobile devices. It’s no longer enough for your site to be mobile-friendly—it has to be mobile-first. This has been as much of a change for marketers as it has been for devs and designers. After all, the experience that someone has when landing on mobile page can make or break every one of your marketing metrics and channels.  

**4. The ascent of vertical video**

If you're reading this, than you already know that the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels has fundamentally reshaped content consumption. Vertical video has become the dominant format, and its influence extends far beyond these platforms. Since these apps are more about keeping users on the app than driving them to external links. This shift forces marketers to rethink how they approach content creation. Instead of using social media as a referral engine, it’s all about building brand awareness and engaging directly with audiences. And even this has already started to become more difficult (see again, ""enshittification"").

**5. The AI revolution (and/or apocalypse)**

Finally, there’s the six-fingered elephant in the room: AI. The rise of tools like ChatGPT et al has already transformed content marketing workflows with new AI-driven tools cropping up every day. While we’re still in the early days of the AI revolution, it’s clear that this isn’t just a fad. AI will continue to reshape how marketers create, distribute, and measure content. I mean, I bet people are reading this post right now who think that it's AI-generated (I swear, it's not though I did use GPT to proofread).

I posted in r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, but also going to drop updates here as well. I wouldn't call us an ""indie hacker"" team because I'm not a one man show, but we're not ""funded"". I have attempted to build around 5 products in earnest over the last 4 years. Each of which left me about \~10-15K in the red. I learned a lot from each attempt though, and finally feel like I just might make this one work.

I am also thinking, would you pay to outsource entire website management? Or are you open to outsource building website for you + exposing CMS? How much would you pay for high converting website, tailored to needs of your company?

1haw07b,Anyone else here have autism / auditory processing disorder (APD) and find going to parties and networking hard?,"I moved back to the bay area from CO primarily because I wanted to do another startup in the AI space.

The problem is I really forgot how much I hate networking and going to parties.

I also have auditory processing disorder (APD) which makes it much harder for me to have discussions in rooms when music is playing or lots of people are taking.

It effectively makes going to super cool events almost pointless to me.

Now I LOVE talking to smart people so if I can hear them I really enjoy it but it's usually in smaller meetings or when people are outside.  

The problem is that this is most of the events I go to.  It's just such a cacophony I can't really focus and just want to leave.

I thought maybe one strategy would be to organize my OWN events that I design to be ideal for me to hear. Like going for hikes or over dinner. Something like that.

Any advice would be awesome!

1hbdz5s,$5.. forever? 😏,"👋🏼 Over the past year, I’ve been diving into software development and product management. Most of my projects have been ambitious and complex (read: nowhere near finished), so I decided to tackle something smaller to gain practical experience.

Recently, I needed to organize my finances for an upcoming move. Instead of creating yet another Google Sheet, I thought, Why not build a simple tool for myself? 🙃

What began as a quick personal project quickly escalated. In just a few days, I developed a full app, complete with a licensing system and a (barebones) marketing site. It’s been a fun learning journey, and it feels great to have something tangible out there instead of endlessly tinkering.

The app is straightforward—it’s an offline finance tool that stores data locally and helps plan finances without relying on bank integrations. While it’s not groundbreaking, it serves my needs and avoids the hassle of dealing with miscategorized transactions.

Here’s where I deviated from the norm: I opted for a $5 lifetime license instead of the typical subscription model. I understand that subscriptions are standard in SaaS, and this approach likely won’t make me rich. However, I wanted to experiment with simplicity and see if a one-time price could still attract interest.

So far, a few sales have come in, boosting my confidence. But I’m curious: Does this kind of pricing make sense for small, low-maintenance tools like this? Or am I missing the mark by not adopting the subscription model?

I've noticed a lot of sales/CRM platforms work primarily on sales funnel and conversions; mostly to close deals. But I've been looking for 'post sales', basically making sure customers onboard properly, use the products the right way etc. I've worked in the past with a couple of larger, more mature startups who predominantly went with enterprise level customers and they're using jury-rigged CRMs to manage those relationships. So they make sure they're touching base with them and they essentially create new 'pipelines' and triggers to check in with a customer if they haven't in a while or if the customer makes a certain action.

I've found what I've been looking at is essentially account management and customer success, but there doesn't appear to many tools specifically for this area. Where they are they're looking purely at retention and churn rather than relationship building and upsell.

Over the last 12 months, I have spent quite a bit of time reading a couple of books related to startups. I have gained good knowledge from these books and I believe these books help all entrepreneurs. So sharing these over here.

\# 1 Cold Start Problem by Andrew Chen

This book taught me deeply about network effects,  how to kick off a marketplace, and how vital mathematics is in building platforms.

\# 2 The Upstarts by Brand Stone

This is the most influential book about how Uber became Uber and what a powerful and relentless entrepreneur Travis Kalanic was. I loved this book and can feel everything that happened inside Uber and Airbnb behind their growth.

\# 3 Pattern Breakers-- Why  some startups change the future  by  Mike Maples

Brilliant insights about why some startups take off, and others don't. If you are an entrepreneur building the ""unknown future"", you must read this.

\# 4 Modern Monopolies by Alex Moazed  
Learned many essential tactics and gained superior knowledge on how to build marketplaces and platforms. Platform Governance and network effects

\# 5 Platform Revolution by Geoffrey G. Parker

Learned detailed knowledge about platforms and marketplaces. Network effects, flywheels

\# 6 Atomic Habits by James Clear

Gained knowledge on how to build habit-forming products using neuroscience and how to build retention for apps

Also, I greatly regret having so many book highlights in this book, but I lost it in a coffee shop—my greatest regret to this day. I always keep one book for spare in my regular coffee shop.

My product also does other things and does them better than the current way of doing so. 

My product has a smaller footprint, has obvious cost saving benefits and comes with help and support via an online platform. 

Therefore do I need to do market validation surveys etc ? 

My product is way better than anything that currently exists in the market. 

For sure I would get some good user feedback from a focus group using my prototype, but other than that I’m not sure if I need to spend much here and should move to the next step. 

The next step is pretty big. It involves selling my house to fund further prototyping, testing, manufacturing and getting ready for the launch.

1hafrv8,Your thoughts on fractional CXOs?,"I was a startup CTO (and co-founder) but after a long 8 year grind I decided to step down. Main reason: the company entered a new phase with main focus on sales and scaling with much less innovation. Came to a point where I simply felt done and started to hate my job.

Took the company from 0 to 1 and grew product and engineering teams from 3 to 40 people. After stepping down I got a handful of offers from other startups but politely declined and took a well-needed sabbatical. Wasn't mentally ready to commit to a new journey just yet. A fellow CTO friend suggested that I try consulting as Fractional CTO. Loved the idea and the flexibility but quickly noticed that the majority of smaller and early-stage startups had tiny budgets and were looking for a lead engineer and not a CTO. While I do love to code I also love to lead people and build teams and culture. 

I understand that you can't bring in a fractional CTO if your company already has a CTO but I also see many in this sub looking for a technical co-founder. In my head, a fractional CTO is the perfect candidate. It's the least risky way to try work together and see if there is personal chemistry and vibe. If we enjoy working together and I believe in the idea I would even strongly consider joining the team if offered. 

On to my question:

I am still figuring out my ICP and where to find the right people (Linkedin sucks ) and wanted to ask people here what their views on fractionals are in general. Have you worked with any? In what phase? If not, did you consider it? Why not?

Please share your honest thoughts, experiences, and of course, opinions!

Thoughts on this idea for a student ticket p2p


is is an (albeit not very original) small idea I've had over the past day, looking to see if it would be viable on a small scale.

Essentially, I'm a college student that's noticed that the ticket market is kinda fucked for alot of students, particularly for reselling and ticket exchanges, students often have to go through WhatsApp in groups, there are alot of scams, and it's not very secure.

the central idea of this is a student-centred p2p marketplace to buy, sell and exchange tickets for (mainly) student events. It could potentially partner with different student groups and societies on campuses, exclusive pre-sale access, possibly local venue partnerships as well, for student discounts of early-bird pricing. There would be price-caps to prevent extreme scalping, and two-factor authenticators using student ID to keep out fraudulent activity.

Revenue generation could come from a small transaction fees, subscription plans, advertising etc. 

There are alot of different ticket apps out there right now, what sets this idea apart is the focus on students and alleviate their specific pain-points. what do you think?",0,startups,1733787955.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hao27x/thoughts_on_this_idea_for_a_studentfocused_ticket/

I have been working at a startup for a couple of months as the founding engineer brought on. Our MVP has been built and started making money but there are no outside investors currently. I have done a significant amount of work on the backend for free due to having a personal relationship with one of the founders and it's more fun than my day job. I am trying to figure out what my expectations should be for equity now that the legal papers are finished.

We are currently bootstrapped and unsure if investors will be needed. The current equity situation has 25% designated for employees and investors - they want to give me 5-6% because they say that investors will be unlikely to invest if given more equity than this and that 5-6% is already triple the market value for equity for an employee (if we had any money to give me a salary as well).

I feel like because I am working for free and will probably be working for free for the next months / year currently that I should be in the range of 10-15%, but I got the sense that they thought this was unreasonable.

1hamrkm,startup ios name advice,"for context im building an ios app in a niche area and i came up with a pretty creative and name that i love - it’s directly related to the niche im building and its a simple but memorable name.

the only problem is that there is someone else in the same niche space who had a similar idea to me with the same name on the App Store. they seem like a small builder with a history of making two apps, but the app im talking about only has 2 reviews for stars and hasn’t been updated in over a year.

even though i am in the same space as the other app and planned to use the name in a fun unique way like the other app, my apps execution is completely different from design to function (even though they address the same problem)

im not that worried about the other app impacting my new apps search because even the other app doesn’t show up in the top 3 for its name - so if people love what I build im hoping my search results will be much better

my main issue right now is that I’ve fallen in love with the name. I came up with it when I first was building the app and now im really really disappointed a very small outdated app has the same one.

I know names don’t mean everything but this one I felt meant a lot as a ios app where the name is also tied to the meaning and ways to market / distribute the app.

there’s no trademark on the name I checked - would you recommend me still using the same name? I know apple has a strict policy but im hoping my execution and actual final product being much better and unique can be enough (especially since the other app hasn’t been updated or used much)

1ha6q7c,"Story about ""re-starting"" successful startup","I have been working on a startup related to 3D printer management. Over the last few years, this segment has changed a lot—new competitors have appeared, and we’re slowly achieving nice numbers in terms of users and new subscriptions.

A year ago, we realized that instead of focusing on creating precise solutions to integrate all 3D printers into our software, the real focus should be on the process itself—the workflow of how 3D models are created and prepared for printing. We always thought we needed to create an end-to-end solution, from the moment the 3D model is created to the time the printer starts working. But this is an incredibly complex problem as a whole, and not all parts of it need solving.

Our biggest target group right now is schools, where the process begins in the classroom with students and their projects. They create a model, send it for review to the teacher, schedule it for printing alongside others, and finally, it gets printed. Interestingly, the last part—the actual printing, which is the most difficult from a ""technical"" perspective—is the least important in the process.

We tried to implement all these steps into our application, but in the end, we built a very complex piece of software that didn’t solve the most critical parts of the workflow.

With all this in mind, I decided to leave this startup and start a new one, bringing with me all the experience and new perspectives I’ve gained. This time, I’m starting from the beginning—thinking before coding. I’m trying to adhere to all the concepts I know exist, but as someone ""over-experienced,"" I sometimes skipped steps in the past. Now, I’m learning to share my ideas publicly, I’ve created a ""signup waitlist"" page for my new startup, and I’m genuinely excited to see how things unfold.

This time, I want to truly enjoy the startup journey. I feel like I have more space, time, and the opportunity to do things properly. And who knows—maybe in the future, my ""old startup"" will evolve into the new one, solving old problems from a fresh perspective.

I just wanted to share this mindset change. It’s been incredibly liberating to leave behind the ""full bag"" that was weighing me down and embrace this ""light running.""",9,startups,1733739748.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ha6q7c/story_about_restarting_successful_startup/
1had5t1,"When a larger company acquires a small SaaS startup, how much do they care about the current team?","To clarify: it seems obvious that you would sell your saas solution because the acquiring company wants the technology and can use it. 
 However, do you think it’s also common that they would value the team because they produced good work in the past, and could hopefully produce more good things/expand the application?  

I can see it being necessary to keep on some of the engineers to perform maintenance, train other staff, incorporate into the other company.  

The reason I’m asking this is because I’m trying to help understand how our current sass company can position itself for acquisition. My CEO seems to think that having the **potential** to solve more market problems (eg by leveraging the current platform, and because the team has a history of some innovative solutions) is something valuable.  Me on the other hand, I feel like the current platform with all his current abilities, is what the only real value that any potential buyer would care about.

As a technical founder who's been in the startup ecosystem for a while, I've noticed a significant rise in MVP development agencies. While I can code, I've been wondering about the general sentiment around outsourcing MVP development, especially given time constraints and the need to focus on other aspects of the business.

I'm curious:

1. Would you consider hiring someone to build your MVP, even as a technical founder? Why or why not?

2. The big question - what's your threshold for MVP development cost? What would you consider a reasonable budget for a solid MVP? (I'm seeing ranges from $5K to $50K+ and honestly not sure what's reasonable anymore)

Would love to hear from those who've gone this route:
- What did you pay?
- Was it worth it?
- Any regrets?

Also, if you chose NOT to outsource, I'd love to hear your reasoning.

P.S. Not looking to outsource right now, just trying to understand the market dynamics and what other founders think is a fair price point for MVP development.",46,startups,1733698334.0,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9v6dj/technical_founder_here_whats_your_take_on/
1hanls4,"Our New Facebook Ads Strategy that made us 7.5 ROAS
","Dude this was crazy!  
  
This is how we've been consistently generating 5-10 ultra qualified. leads per day for our SaaS using facebook ads and conditional logic  
  
We used to struggle because our ads tend to attract a lot of ""wannabe entrepreneurs"" that would sign up then cancel the next month because their business wasn't running yet  
  
Now we attract only people that already have a running business and are looking for a better tool to do their everyday priority tasks  
  
**First - The Ad creatives**  
  
You know, your Saas should be a better alternative to a pre-existing method of executing an everyday task   
  
The idea is: your customer needs to execute a few tasks everyday that are essential for the business to run  
  
Simple example: the uber driver has to drive towards the clients pickup spot  
  
Your Saas should be a superior tool when compared to the traditional method (example: chainsaw vs. hacksaw)  
  
Your facebook ad creative should be a video announcing the viewer that your tool exists and that you're capable of performing XYZ tasks faster and/or cheaper. That's it.  
  
Try to use an instagram Reel format.   
  
**Second - The ad form**  
  
Our biggest shift here was to use facebook's native form.  
  
We plugged it into a google sheets spreadsheet and the form answers  come automatically into the spreadsheet.  
  
But what changed it all was using the ""conditional logic"" feature.  
  
Basically, when you turn it on, you can choose one or more questions that will define an answer as ""qualified"" or not.  
  
So now facebook will only consider those types of answers as an actual ""lead"".  
  
**THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING**  
  
Last month we spent 4k in ads and generated 30k in revenue.  
  
This month we managed to reduce the cost per lead to 1/3rd, plus we doubled our daily ad spend so we're excited for that.  
  
That was only possible due to the increase in lead quality that allowed us to have 24k paid in fulls (2 year contract)   
  
Facebook's native lead form also allowed👉 us to have cheaper leads without losing quality of leads.   
👉I suspect this happened because when the traffic goes to your website facebook have a hard time to track it, but with the native lead form, this is no problem since the traffic is still in facebook.  
  
So recap:  
  
\- your ad creative should attack the inferior alternative to your Saas product  
\- use facebook's native form with the conditional logic turned ON  
\- get Rich

1hacs3q,Finding investors for consumer app,"
Hi,

I'm a technical founder (incorporated) for a new friend and date-finding app launching in Vancouver, Canada. Before you roll your eyes, I want to say that this is near and dear to my heart. So much so that I want to change the industry by offering the most important features for free and significantly undercut popular apps. There will be in-app purchases, yes. But I want to give the people the tools they need to find what they are looking for.

The MVP for iOS and Android is 70% done, and now I'm looking for potential investors to get this off the ground. The expensive part will be chat and database fees, as well as initial marketing in Vancouver (where it will be launched first), to make people aware of the app.

I'm new to all this, and I've learned a lot. But I have no clue how to find and approach people with money, that want to invest in a b2c app.

I would appreciate any tips, contacts, etc. Slide deck available. 

Thanks.

1hank85,Is creating a dating app in 2025 still worth It? Looking for collaboration!,"Hey everyone,

Sorry posting this again as the last got deleted.   
  
So, I’ve been toying with this idea of creating a dating app. I feel like the ones out there haven’t really brought anything new to the table in a while, and I’m wondering if 2025 could be the year to shake things up.

Here’s what I’m curious about:

* Are people still into dating apps? Or has the hype died down?
* Do younger folks still trust apps to find connections, or has that shifted?
* What do you think is missing from the current apps? Something that would actually make dating online less… frustrating?

Also, if anyone out there is interested in building something different with me, hit me up. I think there’s potential to create something fresh, but I’d love to hear from people who’d want to collaborate.

1h9kdd2,Gross Revenue Sharing? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all doing well.   
  
A few months ago, I was researching effective ways to distribute revenue to early business partners in a startup. Specifically, I explored methods like compensating people with equity instead of a salary. During my research though, I found that many individuals who chose to accept equity over a salary in various startups later regretted their decision. A common reason was that some founders often found creative ways to avoid paying dividends. I came across this issue repeatedly through blogs and videos shared by people who experienced it firsthand.   
  
And even if the founders are trustworthy, a late-stage investor with a majority share could intentionally structure the company's finances to ensure profits are funneled toward their own interests, so that early contributors are left with nothing.

After doing some more research, however, I discovered this amazing thing called 'Gross Revenue Sharing'. Gross revenue sharing is a contractual agreement where payouts are based on the gross revenue—the total income a company earns before any expenses are deducted—rather than profits made. 

For example, an agreement might stipulate that if you work for the company for a specific period (say, five years) and meet a clear set of predetermined goals year after year, you will receive a fixed percentage of gross revenue (e.g., 0.001%) annually for the next 50 years(or whatever other number of years would be fair). This ensures a guaranteed reward that is not subject to potentially manipulated profit margins.

This way seems much safer and more secure than the usual equity or profit-sharing deals. And that's why I wanted to ask, with all these benefits, it makes me wonder why gross revenue sharing isn’t more common in the tech industry. Is it because people don’t know about it, doubt it would work, or is there another reason?",10,startups,1733669306.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kdd2/gross_revenue_sharing/

At the time I had 3 clients which is big in my space, most startups fail to get the first client. I ended up only getting $400K, 1 check from a VC and 1 from an existing client. The VC is cool, but when they made intros to their friends it fell apart. The biggest feedback was that they didn't feel that the product was ""defence-able"".

On average, large competitors close 2-3 deals a month with a whole sales team and a marketing team. Solo, I did matched by myself. My product is just 10x better and I know how to sell. 

I now have 15 clients and those will be roughly ~ $1M arr once fully implemented. 3 of 12 major competitors are pulling out of the industry because they suck and the business is too tough for them. I need to take their market share in '25. 

My last VC is in for $500k again, term sheet in hand. 3 clients are pitching in $250k combined. The VC however wants me to raise atleast $1M this time however. (We agree on this number, but it's not necessary for me but they think it is). 

So. I hate talking to VC. I have very little tolerance for them taking time away from my family and my clients. How do I go back previous VC that passed and tell them to give me money in as few words as possible? 

Plan B, is to shoot a text out to all the other start-up CEOs I have made friends with over the last decade, and tell them know I need $250K to round out a $1M raise and see who's going to do me a solid a make an intro. 

If I go outside my existing network, do I have to actually make a pitch deck? Or can I get away without that, or half-ass it. Really don't want to spend the hours to make it perfect. I expect to grow to $5M ARR next year and grow faster than any other company in the space. But I won't do that if I waste my time begging folks for money over Zoom. 

Looking for advice or to vent. The VC world borderline doesn't make sense to me. Why make 100 phone calls to raise $250K and when I make 100 phone calls to earn $1M arr?

1h9kczb,Hesitate if I should release my app that has an major defect.,"Here is the background story. I made an app
that help people to learn music staff. The app will show a note on the screen and let users play it, then, it will listen to what users are playing and compute the frequency via a pitch detection algorithm. If the user does play the right note, he will gain a score. The problem is, the algorithm, provided by a small open source library, suffers from octave error. That is, it will give you doubled or half frequency of the pitch that the user's playing, and this situation happens quite often. This make the app produce falsy result. For example, the app shows a A4 note (the frequency is 440hz), and when a user plays a A3 note (the frequency is 220hz), there is a great chance the app thinks the user plays the right note, because the algorithm outputs a false doubled frequency of what the user's playing (A3). To fix this problem requires lots of efforts for me. Either I have to try different open source libraries and evaluate them, or even write my own algorithm. It is really time-consuming.

As what Learn Startup says, I should build a MVP ASAP and find out whether it is what my customers want, so I am considering to release my app now, even it is far from perfect. However I am also fear that releasing an app with such obvious defect will give them a really bad impression about the app. Since I am going to promote the app to music teachers near my place, and I think it is not easy to find one that is willing to try my app, if they dislike it because of the defect, they won't become my users and give me feedback, and I won't know if the app idea is viable. However if I choose to solve to octave error, I might end up wasting time, since I don't know if people need it. Now I really don't know what should I do.",3,startups,1733669273.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kczb/hesitate_if_i_should_release_my_app_that_has_an/
1h94egx,Incentives sound low to join as a founding engineer,"Assuming you get a 4 year vesting schedule and say the company it gets acquired in M&amp;A deal the year or two after you join.

Example an employee takes a haircut in pay to join a startup, that does well and gets acquired. The employee may have turned their 400k grant to 2M with 2 years left to vest. The acquiring company can determine this is overpaying and reduce their compensation to market pay - let's say 250k stock per year instead of 500K. 

Wouldn't this be less incentive to join a startup vs the alternative of big tech (which will have “uncapped” upside on stock growth + annual refreshers).

1h9347e,I Scaled Two E-Commerce Brands to $1M in Annual Revenue Simultaneously within 2 Years — Here's My Story,"I wanted to share my journey of scaling *two* e-commerce brands to $1M in annual revenue at the same time within two years. It wasn’t easy, and I didn’t follow some “perfect formula.” My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I’m not sharing this as an attempt to “gain karma” or whatever and I’m not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here’s the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I’d “made it.” Spoiler: I hadn’t.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started—broke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I’d ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. “This is it,” I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn’t last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he’d quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in “Print on Demand” platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn’t know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn’t about print on demand—it was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1️⃣ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2️⃣ Make it higher quality.  
3️⃣ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she’s the skeptical type, but she was on board—which made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1️⃣ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it’s not great, it won’t last.  
2️⃣ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3️⃣ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn’t have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here’s the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you’re stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

“The difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it’s literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it’s a choice.”  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It’s up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

1h9j8ie,Insect feed startup in latam (I need a plan),"I have a small business in a Latin American country that produces red runner roaches, mealworms, Zophobas, some black soldier fly larvae, and crickets. All are currently at small-scale levels but with the capacity for growth. I’m a science student and know how to produce them, but I lack expertise in business.

I have some leadership experience from directing a grassroots movement and have many friends and connections, mostly in Latin America and Europe. I currently live in Lisbon and know some people working in venture capital who could help with funding. I also know scientists and professionals from various developing nations from my time at a major international science center, as well as some local politicians and a friend with a farm in Italy.

I feel like I have the conditions to succeed and grow a successful business. However, what’s limiting us is that both my business partner and I are more focused on biology and science. My partner has a BSc in biology, works in wildlife conservation (birds), and raises cattle. I’m a physicist studying evolution and biology, specifically yeastcell biology. Despite our skills, we struggle to concentrate on growing the business.

Right now, we’re making around $65 in small monthly sales, while I pay $130 and my associate $200 out of pocket to cover food for the insects and electricity. Some tasks, like producing more insects, are easier than building something like an oven to dry them.

Our goals include:

• Increasing sales

• Producing our own chicken feed

• Selling compost as a by-product

• Entering the biotech market with products like chitosan

Currently, we have one part-time employee and occasionally hire a second person on a day-to-day basis. I want to hire a friend with extensive entomology experience who worked at a mealworm startup (to which I sold the original colony for $3k), but I can’t afford to hire him full-time. I’m considering paying him a daily rate and having him work a few times a month.

I’d like to buy a solar dryer to start prototyping chicken feed with the BSF but feel unsure about how to move forward. I also own two generic domain names but think we need a better business name. I believe we should create a LinkedIn page, ask friends to share on social media, and build our presence online.

What would you do if you were in my position? I need to balance my time between my PhD and building this business, which I see as a critical part of my future without leaving science entirely.",1,startups,1733665800.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9j8ie/insect_feed_startup_in_latam_i_need_a_plan/

1h9tqi6,"I'll be a hiring a technical founder to manage the development of a proprietary software platform and offering equity in the company as compensation. We are bootstrapped, what is fair?","I run a sales agency, we provide outsourced sales services to other businesses or startups, from lead generation to closing contracts. We are a team of account executives with years of sales experience, most of us were previously in tech sales. We have clients who have hired us as their outsourced sales team so there is revenue already coming into the business. Right now we use third-party VoIP calling services, email services, and CRMs (i.e. Salesforce) on a subscription basis paid for by the clients so they can have access to the entire sales process for transparency. It gets pricey for them and we'd like to instead develop our own proprietary software platform that integrates VoIP, CRM, and sales tools. We obviously cannot create a VoIP service from scratch but we can for everything else, so we'll just be integrating the VoIP through API from our preferred provider. This way we can offer the same services to our clients in a more affordable and reliable way through our proprietary software.

I've been interviewing for a Technical Product Manager position that will eventually develop to the Chief Technology Officer as the company grows. The TPM will lead the development of the software platform, managing the software engineers/devs who will also be compensated in equity or hired on a contract basis, and pretty much leading the vision of the product. I'll  be reviewing final interviews soon and can't decide on the exact details of compensation. 

We own 100% of the company, and other ""employees"" we have outside of us are contracted and compensated with commissions or on a job by job basis, but for this TPM position, it will be different. Whoever I hire will be on this with us for long run. They will have to be as dedicated and excited about this startup as we are. The people I'm interviewing for this position are completely aware that compensation will be mainly in the form of equity as well as sporadic income (for instance, after whatever is leftover of monthly revenue in NOI after debts and commissions are paid, I'll be determining what I can give whether it's a few hundred dollars here in there but not guaranteed every month). I've read of the possibility of providing equity over the months or as milestones are met. The people I'm interviewing have experience in product management, managing software teams, and development. Some have bachelors degrees and some have their masters.

1h9s097,Repost with more info: How do I show tens of ideas for cofounders to choose without getting my ideas stolen?,"Ok, let me repost this because I didn't explain and obviously it went out of control: people went with the usual ""Nobody will steal your ideas"" or the ""idea is nothing without execution”.

Please read, and I hope you can help me.

Hi guys, I have lots of startup ideas and I was wondering which was the best way to share these ideas with possible technical cofounders for them to choose without getting my ideas exposed.

The goal would be to create a startup lab where students and new devs can pick and choose what they want to develop (based on their skills and experience) to learn how to be a startupper and be guided by this lab.

I already received green light from the townhall and our university that will allocate resources to fund this lab and the ideas that will be born from it.

Trust me, if I just wanted to make money it would be much easier to just gather investors and launch the ideas in the list starting from the best to the worst but I'm not doing this for money, at least not only for that.
I genuinely want to do good, I want to create something that will help people create new things and new companies in this new environment where they’re guided, without the risk of more experienced startuppers or software houses stealing the “formative” work.

I could talk literally for hours about this thing but please trust me that I'm not a random guy that just wants to protect his ideas while he talks to devs.

So going back to the “problem”:

Obviously I can't make them sign NDAs for tens, maybe even a hundred, of ideas, and I can't even make them sign a single NDA for all of them because then the contract won't be specific enough.

how would you do? ",0,startups,1733689781.0,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9s097/repost_with_more_info_how_do_i_show_tens_of_ideas/

1h8g50t,I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer,"Had a beer with a buddy of mine the other day—he’s a CRO at a 130-person tech startup. Out of nowhere, he’s like, “Man, I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer.” Not gonna lie, I laughed at first, but then I realized he was dead serious.

So I ask him what’s up, and he just starts venting. He said the hardest part is he feels like he’s supposed to know everything that’s happening in the company, but it’s impossible. Marketing’s doing one thing, sales is doing another, and customer success is in their own little world. And somehow, he’s supposed to connect all the dots and make the revenue grow?

Then he talks about how he has all these big plans—like where they need to be in 6 months, how they should be scaling, all that good stuff. But when it comes to actually putting those plans into action, it’s a mess. Teams don’t align, priorities clash, and stuff just doesn’t get done. He said it feels like no matter how much effort he puts in, something’s always slipping through the cracks.

His exact words: “It’s like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it’s lost deals and missed opportunities. And I’m the only one holding the hammer.”

Honestly, it sounded rough, and it got me wondering—do other CROs feel this way too?

If you’re a CRO (or close to one), what’s the hardest part of your job? Is it the lack of visibility, the struggle to get stuff done, or something else? 

Would love to hear how you deal with it.

1h8pt5k,Cold email works! here's my experience/recommended tools,"I’ve been sending cold email outreach - both for sales of my PR agency and database and to contact journalists/creators on behalf of clients - for around 3 months now.

Stone cold. Zero prior relationship. At massive scale (with AI).

And I was skeptical. But guess what? It works.

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I’ve learnt a ton so far that’s helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don’t rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

Google Workspace  
Apollo  
Coldsire  
Clay  
Instantly

If you’re not cold email outreach with AI, try it! You’d be surprised. Happy to answer more specific questions.",17,startups,1733567604.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h8pt5k/cold_email_works_heres_my_experiencerecommended/

I'm an aspiring entrepreneur discussing some AI product ideas with potential customers and engineers to get feedback. My goal is to have open and collaborative conversations but also ensure everyone is on the same page regarding roles and expectations.

I want to avoid situations where someone thinks they deserve equity or ownership just for providing input. However, I also really value these relationships and don't want them to sour due to misunderstandings. Protecting the work is important but maintaining trust and goodwill is equally critical.

I'm looking for advice from other founders on how to strike the right balance:

* What's the best way to communicate upfront to avoid incorrect expectations?
* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

My aim is to build strong, productive connections while being transparent. I don't want to be overly guarded but also want to mitigate the risk of misunderstandings that could undermine trust.

I’m pricing the online community in two membership tiers. One oriented towards aspiring students thinking about entering a specific field, and existing students across 15 or so US universities at a price point to $49.95 a month. The next tier is professional level, existing community members in early to mid career, looking to connect with professionals in the industry at a price point of $99 a month.

Those who are in this industry are fairly affluent. It is hard to enter the industry, and 99% of those who do go through a masters program. 

Building critical mass early is important. I’ve thought about, but I’ve decided not to offer a free tier. My concern being that the community is flooded with wannabes and ultimately would devalue the community. 

I’m trying to solve for Network effect. I currently do not have any members.

I thought about offering coupon codes to industry insiders they could pass out to others to join that would provide for a period of free access to the site so long as they use a credit card to sign up. I thought about swag after the second month of payment. I’m going to be using an affiliate program , so any new users can refer others for a percentage of the revenue.

We have been good friends for a while and always talked here and there about starting a company. I kind of stopped the ""talking"" and got to work and a week or two later told my friend that hey this is what I have been working on and we agreed to do it together.  I am CEO and he joined as CTO. 

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could! 

  
TLDR: 2 week hire wants to be CFO (they are good at what they do so far) what is the best way to judge if they are suitable and what would be a good compensation model for them given they are not a cofounder?

1h8wajl,Question about “paid pilots” with MVP for B2B SaaS startup. What to charge?,"We are preseed bootstrapped hoping raise in mid Q1. We want to get customer feedback to inform our first real release to the market, but also want to show traction to investors. MVP will be ready in Q1. The MVP will be very useful, but since our product is a data insights product on publicly available data, we will only have data loaded for one very important state (not 50). (We will be adding more data over the subsequent year.) So whatever we charge for the pilot (if that is the right thing to do) that initial price will not be close to what we eventually charge. My cofounder and I have lots of warm contacts in this sector in which we’ve been working for many years. We’ve used these contacts to give us feedback as we’ve developed the concept, wireframes, and potential market fit. Right now there is no product on the market, which does what our product does.

I wasn't too familiar with this, but the CEO assured me this is how everyone in the company, including the cofounders, are getting equity, and it'll be better since we won't have to worry about all the inane stock option details like exercise price, vesting periods, expiration, etc...

Well, it hasn't happened yet.

But here’s the thing: if you split it up, there’s practically one program for every three startups across the entire country. It’s gotten to the point where these initiatives are actively calling startups to headhunt them into their competitions or programs.

This results in startups spending way too much time on flashy competitions and endless programs, and way less time actually running their businesses. There is only so many competitions you can go to before you actually need to start selling to customers.

\- Award me 5% equity in the business (which they are both happy with).

  
They've agreed, but they said they'd want to give me 1% now (which I have upped to 2% because it's just a bit crap, plus the numbers don't add up), and another 1% every 2 months for 6 months to keep us all aligned and motivated.

For the Clients we intent to solve the following problems:

 

• The hassle to find the best candidate for their tech project

• Fear of scams, incomplete/substandard work or getting ghosted by programmers

• Lack of accountability by any freelance site regarding the work of their freelancers

• Regular Management and Coordination of the project between multiple programmers

• Help find suitable projects which suits their skill and experience

• Opportunity to pool their talent on a bigger project and work with people with different skills and experience.

• Build skills working on real world project and also earn money doing so.

• Even as a beginner, start with free projects to earn points and earn enough points to apply for paid projects.

1h91q7g,I’m building an open source AI marketing bot that you can run for FREE (using Ollama),"We all know how valuable Reddit is for shilling your product (just look at this sub). A lot of founders are using it to promote their products.

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I’ve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it’s so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I’ve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I’ve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don’t deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I’m basically running it for free.

Would be curious about if anyone would like to give it a try. I’m building it as an open source tool, but I don’t have any docs yet. So leave a comment for me to know there would be interest and I’ll write docs so you can run it yourself.

Last thing I want to say: I also hate reddit bots and the idea with this tool is not to spam my product. I’m fine tuning it to behave just as I would manually and limiting the number of comments it can post in a day.",0,startups,1733604073.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h91q7g/im_building_an_open_source_ai_marketing_bot_that/

1h892yq,"I launched my MVP, started with the sales. This is what I found out:","Spoiler: I am not able to make a sale, and I don't see it as a bad thing.

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

Its an app in a certain niche so I don't expect it go much high but still the community is growing. 

Here's the issue which I am facing:

My costs are escalating for Bubble and my WUs have passed 1.5 million, and now I am close to getting billed in 1k on monthly basis. On top of that, I want to do something with the app which I can't do technically. 

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

I also received quotations from 5 agencies more and it was around 35-65k USD and on top of that a maintenance and support contract.

1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I’d love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team’s mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team’s energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project’s progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can’t do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important to recognize that. Admitting that you can’t do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it’s more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

1h8glkz,I'm beyond fucked right now,"Hi, I'm 18M. A non technical founder. Since the past 4 months I've working on an online shopping app for my country, as there is a huge gap in the apps space here. I know zero coding and had hired a developer for cheap to develop the app for me, now the app is almost complete but i'm unsure about what i'll do for the maintenance of the app since the guy I was working with says that he'll be too busy to give it any tike. 

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code) 

I can either find someone to do maintenance for the app so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what's the procedure for that, what to keep in mind when hiring or giving access to the app, guidelines etc as I have zero tech knowledge. 

Also, if I hire a developer for maintenance, are there any chances he can like steal the app from me? like remove my access or anything (I'm already sorry if any of this sounds super silly) 

Another option I have is learn the basics myself and try to fix minor bugs myself if I come across any. Could you tell me how long would it take not to learn complete IOS or android development, but just simple maintenance or fixing bugs?

1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this. I talked with a lawyer friend who said that charging fees is pretty normal, but usually for basic work like this it's a much smaller fee. So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for! It feels a little like a tactic to minimize share transfers by former employees - they're taking it just because they have gatekeeping access. 

I had a great experience with the company and I'm super friendly with the people there still - how would you handle this? Is this something you've seen before? Should I just pay it and get it over with? I'm considering reaching out to the general counsel to ask about it or try negotiating.",17,startups,1733441773.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7naik/5k_processing_fee_from_company_for_selling_50k/
1h7k5e0,What I Wish I Did Sooner as a New Founder (Advice for You!),"**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here’s the one thing I’d do differently…**

**Document your journey.**

It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you’re working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here’s why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you’re deep in the grind, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you’ve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I’ve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I’ve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I’m bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I’ve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It’s one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you’re just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you’re doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you’re not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I’ve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

**Don’t wait. Start documenting today, even if it’s just for yourself, you’ll thank yourself later.**",25,startups,1733433519.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7k5e0/what_i_wish_i_did_sooner_as_a_new_founder_advice/

1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace — Do’s and Don’ts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don’t**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash’s founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don’t**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub’s early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **“Aha” Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don’t**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb’s Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace’s reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don’t**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors’ successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don’t**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace’s liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

1h87kt3,Carpooling could disrupt the cab industry.,"Carpooling has the potential to eat into the regularized cab industry, but it’s not yet structured or well-backed by tech.

We humans love connecting with qualified strangers, and carpooling can make that possible. Imagine an executive traveling 15 km to their company. Instead of a ride with an unknown driver, they can carpool with a consultant who’s been in the industry for 20-25 years. 

The value of such an exchange is immeasurable—valuable knowledge shared, strong networks built, and a higher level of security compared to rides with drivers from lower strata or remote areas.

To make this a reality, several things need to be fixed:

1.Quick Availability of Drivers: We need a large number of drivers ready to offer rides, ensuring easy availability.

2.Modernized Mobile App: A highly efficient app is key to seamlessly matching users and drivers.

3.Security: Carpooling with qualified professionals provides higher security compared to unknown drivers.

4.Networking Opportunities: It’s not just about getting from point A to B—it’s about building connections and learning from others during the ride.

Carpooling can be the game-changer in our commuting experience. Let’s take it to the next level!",0,startups,1733508338.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h87kt3/carpooling_could_disrupt_the_cab_industry/

1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I’m a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers—just a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we’d never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here’s what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki’s 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you’re a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it’s vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it’s a significant issue worth solving.

I’d follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I’d revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails—no friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* “This investor will drill into your TAM—make sure it’s airtight.”
* “Avoid using the term ‘AI agent’ with these firms.”

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there’s one thing I wish someone had told me: Don’t raise money in the summer.

1h7aic5,My friend's dad passed away and i am trying to help him.,"Hey Reddit, I’m here hoping to get some guidance from this amazing community.

A close friend of mine recently lost his father, and it’s been devastating for their family. His dad was involved in the alco-bev industry for over 20 years, co-running a company with a few partners. He wasn’t the technical guy, and played a key role in sales and relationships.

After his passing, the other founders have been trying to push my friend out of the company. It’s heartbreaking to see him struggle like this, especially since he now has the huge responsibility of providing for his family.

He’s trying to start his own business in the same field, focusing on importing Vatted Malt Spirit (VMS) from Scotland to India. The thing is, he doesn't know much about how this supply chain works or how to even get started. But he wants to continue in this field since his father accumulated a lot of good will in this industry and he kinda wants to continue his father's legacy.

If anyone has experience in the alco-bev industry, especially with Scottish distilleries or international supply chains, I would really appreciate your advice. My friend has lost so much already, and I just want to do everything I can to help him rebuild.

1h745jt,AI hardware startup in Bay Area offer. Low balled?,"I got a job offer (senior staff engineer) at a 2 year old startup which has raised $100M so far. The number of shares they offered me is 12,500 (vested in 4 years). The company’s current valuation is around $300M. Their LFR price per share is $10.

Given all this, I think even if the company becomes a unicorn, I still won’t get that much. And it would be better for me to just keep looking.

1h7eo7c,PLEASE consider also other pricing options than Subscriptions,"A full time business/start up coach here! I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It’s been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here’s what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it. 

Bad: You’re critiquing humans, basically, so that’s tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends “I needed online dating help so I paid for it”? No customer retention because they’d get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site’s marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We’d review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out. 

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we’d have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it’s income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn’t make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I’m a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about. 

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect. 

It died because: I didn’t pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn’t know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don’t refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to “build a better mouse trap.”

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools. 

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating. 

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself. 

Bad: User acquisition wasn’t easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn’t pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500. 

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property. 

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don’t assume a company’s internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn’t jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales. 

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted…

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like “Vacord Industries, LLC.” and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just “Vacord” so the emails can be more like “Hey Jack, how’s your xyz at Vacord?” Instead of “Hey Jack, how’s xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?”

Good: People said they’d pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out. 

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:  There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again…

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn’t mean you’ll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It’s easier to market than anything else has been, and it’s got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say “I’m really glad we found your tool” is huge to me. 

Bad: It’s a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it’s growing slowly. I’m starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don’t be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you’re wasting your time and money building something that won’t work in the market.

\----

This isn’t even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing €75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

1h6r9vv,First 100 users for my app in a couple of weeks -Lessons learned so far,"It’s incredibly exciting to hit my first 100 users, and I’m especially proud because I did it without any paid advertising! Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You’re Solving** It’s easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else—fundraising, branding, or scaling—comes second to making sure you’re solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I’ve been building this while working a 9–5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You’re More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you’ll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It’s tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup—branding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you’re not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it’s worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always).

Something Like “seraphim “
Or “Minos” or “Cthulhu”

1h6iy9o,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what AI can do for your business—if you start today.",2,startups,1733326668.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/

We are building a tool to create automated product catalogs. Here’s how it will work-

You give us a google sheets link to your products which has the product name, image, description, price etc. 

You can either upload a png of your catalog background or we can import your designed template from canva.

We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.

We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.

Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.

You can download your catalog as a pdf

My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.

While catalog generation and updation is a bottleneck for them, they want it as a service. Where we create excel, create catalog template and generate catalogs for them. Would anyone be interested in this as a diy tool?",2,startups,1733311485.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6dt5g/customers_only_want_managed_service_model_and_not/
1h5oz6l,The Product-Market-Fit confirmation I could only dream about,"Hey there! I'm solo building my SaaS for more than 2 years now, selling for 13 months already. I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster. 

But most importantly, I know have a strong feeling, I'm building something meaningful.

And I wish you all experience the same thing! (unless you already did ;)) 🚀",88,startups,1733237070.0,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5oz6l/the_productmarketfit_confirmation_i_could_only/
1h6cqec,Co-Founders or Investors for SMBs,"
I’m a software engineer based in Australia with startup experience—I ran a small company with 5 employees for 3 years and sold it 10 years ago.

I’ve built an AI app, available only on the App Store, for small businesses like plumbers and electricians. The app helps with:

Invoicing: For example, a plumber can say, “Just fixed John Doe's dishwasher, bill him $200,” and it generates the invoice.

Task management and client tracking

Ad campaigns: Users can ask the AI to set up a Facebook ad to find customers nearby.

Website updates: Easily update pricing or services with voice commands.

The app is live but still in early stages. Some people downloaded it, but no one has registered yet. I also need to add key features like ad campaign tools.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I look for co-founders with skills in online ads (like Google or Facebook Ads) or technical expertise to help grow it?

Or should I focus on finding investors so I can hire a dev team and salespeople?

What’s the smarter choice to grow from here? If co-founders are the answer, how do I find the right ones? If it’s investors, where do I start without a user base?

I’d really appreciate your advice. Thanks!

1h6cn1l,"36 startup ideas found by analyzing podcasts (problem, solution &amp; source episode)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains – this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

I'll generally send \~5 ideas per week in a short weekly digest format (you can see the format I'd usually use in here: podcastmarketwatch.beehiiv.com).

I find it mindblowing that the latest models with large context windows make it even possible to analyze full transcripts at such scale. It's a very exciting time we're living through!

Would love some feedback on this stuff, happy to iterate and improve the analysis/ideas... or create a new newsletter on a different topic if anyone would like.

1h6ar6x,Startup Wisdom: Done is Better Than Perfect,"Hey there, startup enthusiasts and fellow entrepreneurs,

I’ve got some advice to share that’s been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? “Done is better than perfect.” Don’t get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100. Then, based on user feedback, you can decide whether to continue investing in improving the product or to pivot.

1h5y72m,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?","So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built?

1h5yefu,"Am I thinking correctly about how to develop an ideal client profile for a tool to help websites deal with bot traffic? 
","We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

Am I missing something here?

Am I thinking about it the right way?

Stealth AI is your personal expense optimizer. It analyzes your P&amp;L, finds cheaper alternatives for every expense, rates the hassle of switching (A+ to F), and delivers monthly reports with actionable savings. It even scours the web and user reviews to ensure smarter spending decisions. Save money without the headaches—effortlessly.

# Why Now?

* **Economic Pressure**: Businesses are facing tighter margins and growing pressure to cut costs amidst economic uncertainty.
* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.
* **Demand for Efficiency**: Companies are increasingly seeking tools to streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize ROI.

# Competition

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don’t actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.
* **DIY Research**: Most businesses rely on manual comparisons and reviews, which is time-consuming and prone to missed opportunities.

I’m doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I’ve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners—things like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don’t fit founders’ needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts to help shed light on what really matters to founders when choosing a bank.

If you’re a founder, here are a few quick questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	Who do you currently bank with, and why did you choose them?
	2.	What were the most important factors in choosing your bank (e.g., fast onboarding, reputation, digital tools)?
	3.	What’s one thing you wish your banking partner did better?
	4.	At what stage of growth did having a strong banking relationship become critical for your startup?

Feel free to answer any or all of these! Your insights will go into a write-up I’m working on, and I’m happy to share the findings if you’re interested—just let me know in the comments.

1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *“Why not try making my own dream come true?”*. That’s when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3
* Adding folders to organize chats
* Saving and reusing prompts
* Pinning important chats
* Exporting chats to TXT/JSON files
* Deleting or archiving multiple chats at once
* Making chat history searches faster and better

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *“You’re a lifesaver!”* That’s when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I’ve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It’s been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I’ve started working on another extension for Claude, which I’m hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

Even though the upvotes were low at \~15, the amount of traffic was pretty decent spiking at 1,100 DAU which was amazing. This makes me think 2 things. Firstly, lots of people  were intrigued enough to try the app and didn't really like it so they didn't upvote.

I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

1h5g3a6,Need Guidance to Start My Journey in the Biomedical Device Industry,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a med student, and over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in the biomedical device industry. Reading the Biomedical Devices Bill of 2023 really opened my eyes to the potential of this field, and I feel drawn to contributing to it in a meaningful way after completing med school.

That said, I’m at a point where I realize I need guidance. I don’t have mentors or a network in this space, and I’m unsure about where to start or how to approach this field the right way.

If anyone here has experience in the biomedical device industry—or knows someone who does—I’d be so grateful for your advice. Even a brief conversation to understand the landscape, key skills, or first steps to take would mean a lot to me.

I’m eager to learn and open to any insights or resources you’re willing to share. Thank you for reading and for any help you can offer!

1h54n5u,Need Advice: Working for a Startup with No Pay (yet) – Stocks vs. Profit Sharing?,"Hey everyone,

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There’s no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We’re not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here’s the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we’ve put into the company. Right now, he’s unable to pay more money because he’s fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states **""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""** which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I’m a software engineer—I can code fast and efficiently—but this feels like uncharted territory.

I’m currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I’m not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I’m skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes, **stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He’s also offered $500–$1000 a month, but I’d honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here’s my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I’d really appreciate any advice or perspectives from this community. Sorry for the long post, and thanks in advance!",5,startups,1733170788.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h54n5u/need_advice_working_for_a_startup_with_no_pay_yet/

After 4 years of working as a software dev at a full-time job, I’m finally taking the leap and starting my own SaaS journey. It feels like a big step—exciting, but also a little intimidating to start something on my own.

SaaS has always fascinated me: the idea of building something scalable that solves real problems for people. I’ve worked on plenty of projects over the years—some super exciting, others just routine bug fixing—but I’ve always loved the process of turning raw ideas into something functional and (hopefully) valuable.

Now, I’m diving into it full-time. My plan is to help others—early-stage founders, solo entrepreneurs, or anyone sitting on a SaaS idea—bring their visions to life. I’ll be sharing what I learn, mistakes I make, and hopefully some wins along the way.

I am currently a junior in college. I previously, in highschool and at the start of college, ran an Etsy 3D Printing store. I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea. Over the past 3 years, I have had multiple Venture Capital and Incubator internships, working at some pretty large VCs, one having $500M in AUM. I have learned a lot through these internships, specifically on the deal sourcing side and raising side, and I think I would make a really valuable non-technical founder. I also have gained a really strong network of potential capital raisers, and my dad is a lawyer who works with Startups and Venture Capital firms to raise money.

However, I realize that I need to focus on product, acquiring customers, and proving that there is a demand for my e-commerce platform. I am apprehensive about reaching out to my network of VCs for mentoring/advice in case I want to raise with them in the future. My dad has been really supportive but has more experience in the raising aspect, and I am apprehensive about asking him to leverage his network because I am afraid of ruining his reputation (which is very good in his field/area).

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I’m not sure if it’s something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

**How You Can Help**

What do you think of this idea? Does it sound like something you’d use or recommend to someone? Also, what features would you prioritize in a platform like this? Any feedback or suggestions would be incredibly helpful!

1h4uu0k,What marketing skills are required for joining early startups? ,"Hi :) 

  
I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

Navigating the startup world can be overwhelming, especially when resources are scattered and hard to find.

If you’re not from a specific region or deeply connected, these opportunities can feel hidden.

So, I decided to create a free, searchable directory of Michigan startup resources. It’s designed for entrepreneurs and founders to quickly filter resources by region and tags, making it easy to find exactly what you need—no endless Googling or outdated lists.

This started as a personal project to help me organize everything, but I realized how much value it could provide to others in the startup ecosystem. My goal is to keep it updated and add even more resources over time.

I’d love your feedback:

* Does something like this sound useful for navigating your state’s startup ecosystem?
* Are there similar tools you’ve used or would recommend?

If you’re interested in checking it out or want to share your thoughts - let me know.",1,startups,1733127795.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4qd6o/a_free_searchable_directory_of_michigan_startup/
1h4daw1,Is a patent or IP necessary?,"Hi everyone, I’m building a startup in the healthcare field. I wrote the code during a research year in medical school. I wasn’t enrolled and the school has already said they won’t claim any ownership of the Intellectual Property. 

But a lot of my mentors, who are physicians so aren’t familiar with software startups, advised me to pursue a patent. I’ve heard that software is impossible to patent and usually a copyright is good enough. 

My school, while currently not claiming ownership of the software, says that they are happy to pay the ~$30,000 required to file the patent/IP paperwork as long as I give them full rights to it. 

I don’t want to do that, especially since I have other investors who are happy to cover those costs while only wanting some equity in the company. 

My question is do I really need to file for an IP? If not, what would prevent another company from coming in and doing the same thing I’m trying to do? Other than not having the credibility among the customer base or other external factors like that. 

Thanks for your help!

I tried out some of these coupons, and they don't need any user account association.

Instead of wasting these coupons, would it be viable to create a platform, where people can upload their coupons and exchange them for a different one from another user! Kindof like a bidding platform.

Incase they do not like any coupons to exchange for, maybe they can set a nominal price on the coupons, so someone else can pay to buy.

1h488p4,Carta Pricing,"I recently looked into Carta's discounts for early-stage tech startups and thought I'd share what I found, in case it's useful to others. If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don’t meet those criteria, you’ll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven’t already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free—Stripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

Hope this info is helpful!

1h49urb,What’s your top priority for onboarding right after launching a customer-facing service?  ,"Onboarding is the backbone of any customer-facing service.  
No matter how amazing your product is, if users don’t understand it or it takes too long to get started, it’ll quickly become a service no one uses.  

Plus, being too hesitant to show a paywall can hold back revenue, and a trial period that’s too short might stop users from even giving it a chance.  

Here’s what I’ve learned in the first three months of launching my product:  
- Early on, improving onboarding beats developing new features.  
- Letting users start without an account boosted tutorial completion rates by 10%.  
- Don’t fear the paywall—it’s there for a reason.  
- Nobody reads long explanations—let them dive into the experience instead.  
- Open-ended freedom doesn’t work—guide users with a clear first step.  
- Design and fonts? They matter way more than you think.

1h42ybs,"5 Years into my Startup Journey: From DJI to COO of a Startup - Reflecting on Growth, Challenges and Seeking Advice","Hey ​guys,

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

Would love to hear your stories and insights.",5,startups,1733058641.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h42ybs/5_years_into_my_startup_journey_from_dji_to_coo/
1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

What do you think of those strategies? Any feedback is welcome.",0,startups,1733086978.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4dgoy/got_a_longterm_idea_for_a_startup_but_currently_0/

1h3lod0,How do I get first users to sign up?,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

1h3kcss,"Two similar apps lunched against our app , should I reach out and try to make a team with the competitors?","So I’m discovering that people (mostly individuals) have been lunching similar app to what I wanna do .

Their apps are not top level and considered more of mvp or below , while mine is top notch (but still have not lunched).

I posted about the issue before , but now I’m thinking of just reaching out and trying to form a team for 1 startup .

This unfortunately would probably cost me equity as I’m pretty sure i will max at 33.3% if not less .

Have anyone done it ? 

Do you guys think this is a good idea ?

At the end of the day I wanna build a team around the startup so in my thoughts this is not bad .

My ideal route would have been to lunch and beat everyone and then employ the competitors under me without losing equity, but I don’t wanna dream too big and then end up with nothing .

1h2lcnk,Why is Roblox still not profitable despite being the biggest game in the world? ,"This has been puzzling me. Roblox boasts five times the players of Minecraft or Fortnite. On any given day, over 80  million people  log onto the app. That’s an insane scale. Yet, I came across a stat showing Roblox spends about $138 for every $100 in revenue over the last year. How is this possible? Sure, app stores take their cut, but they don’t seem to spend much on marketing, and with fewer than 10,000 employees, labor costs don’t seem overly excessive either. Smaller games like Fortnite and Minecraft are massively profitable.

1h24jxo,how I learned to sell as a founder (without feeling like a sleazy salesperson),"If you think sales are only for “salespeople,” you’re probably leaving money on the table. After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here’s the truth: sales isn’t about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I’ve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50–100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer’s pain points.
4. **Don’t Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return—like a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you’re not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you’re flying blind.

Do you agree or disagree? I’d love to hear your take. LMK!",209,startups,1732824464.0,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h24jxo/how_i_learned_to_sell_as_a_founder_without/

It's a major outage now at 2 hours 36 minutes and counting. Imagine building a product and just starting to get traction and your product stops working for 2 and a half hours.

We were in the middle of a demo just now and a key component of our app stopped working. Thankfully it didn't affect our demo too much, but it hurts.

I did the math, just looking at their reported uptime for the API alone 99.33%... that's over 2 and a half days of downtime in a year!!

1hcg7nz,Startup Culture,"- Great businesses are all about a great idea.
- Ideas are nothing; it’s all execution. &lt;— we are here.
-  Execution is nothing; it’s resilience.
- Resilience is nothing; it’s timing.
- It’s all just luck.

This pretty much sums up how I feel about startup culture. 

First it was all about the idea, people are obsessed with coming up with the next big thing. Then about execution, and we get bombarded with hustle culture… But then even great execution doesn’t guarantee success. That’s where resilience comes in - sticking with it, pivoting when necessary, and refusing to give up. Except resilience means nothing if you launch a great product at the wrong time.

But then there’s luck. The thing no one wants to admit is that luck.. being in the right place at the right time, connected or rich parents, born in the right location or right time, meeting the right person, or stumbling into the perfect market etc… often plays the biggest role. But books don’t sell the recipe for luck.

1hcpl40,"Ready to run an ad campaign for my vocabulary app, where should I start?","A month ago I launched vocabulary app that lets users explore advanced english words, save ones they want to learn, and then teach themselves the words by taking simple multiple choice quizzes made from example sentences.

The idea is that we learn words by seeing them in context, so there are about 100 example sentences per word allowing the user to get exposure to a bunch of different usages.

It has about 400 downloads, most of which are friends and family + some people from reddit.

I assume I probably won't ever make much money off this app, but I have seen the main Vocabulary app on the App Store have millions of downloads + saw on SensorTower that it generates about $200k per month in revenue. I actually began using this app when I was looking for what my app offers, but honestly was not impressed with the feature offerings.

I'm assuming they probably have pretty high cost on marketing because I see them all over instagram and they come up as the first ad on the app store. Anyways, that makes me think that there is at least decent interest in the ""vocabulary building"" space and a potential to generate some revenue.

This is also my first project and I spent a lot of time on it, so I'm willing to go a few grand in the hole to see if I can get a lot of downloads. If I do, then maybe I could throw some ads on the app or introduce a premium version and paywall some of the features. Idk.

Anyways, would love to get advice on which direction to go.

This is what I'm deciding between:

1. Instagram ads - tooting my own horn here but I think the app has a pretty solid looking UI, so I think the visual nature of instagram lends itself pretty well. Also instagram ads in general seem to be very effective (at least in my personal experience)
2. App store optimization - when I was looking for an app like this I just went to the app store and looked up vocabulary, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Maybe there are other people doing the same thing?
3. Reaching out to vocabulary / dictionary / productivity influencers

I would prefer to only do one of these options and commit 1-2k over the course of a few months.

1hcp20z,How Do I Gather My First Users for My Deals/Discounts Website?,"Hi everyone,

I launched my website about a month ago—a platform similar to HotUKDeals where users can find deals/discounts and upload their own deals to earn a 25% commission on each sale.

After the launch, I started promoting on social media (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and slowly started building followers (Insta: 55, Facebook: 13, TikTok: 23). Through Google Analytics, I can see some traction—about 300 new visitors weekly—but apart from family, nobody has purchased anything via affiliate links.

I’m passionate about the concept and still believe in its potential. However, I’m struggling to build a critical mass of users. I know that to create a successful platform, I need more users to upload deals, which will lead to more sales, more profit, and, ideally, a positive growth loop.

So far, I’ve tried:
	•	Posting regularly on social media.
	•	Following and engaging with people active on similar platforms.

But growth feels slow, and I’m looking for actionable advice to:
	1.	Drive more traffic to the website.
	2.	Encourage people to upload their own deals.
	3.	Build trust and encourage users to make purchases.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear what worked for you. I’m open to any tips, including unconventional ideas or strategies that might not be immediately obvious.

Happy to share more details about my platform, social media strategy, or analytics if that helps!

|fika|Easy to connect and schedule, spoke to an associate who was respectful and intelligent. Did a quick follow up with one of the key partners. The partner meeting looked a bit disengaged and barely asked questions. It seemed he didnt want to be there :) The associate promptly responded in a few days with a respectful reject email citing reasons that seemed genuine. Overall, would still recommend working with them based on the interaction.|8/10|
|Firebolt|The founding partner himself tracked down the startup from a ""VC dark network"". He was persistent. Had 1 call with 2 of the founding partners. They were fully engaged. However, 1 partner who initially reached out seemed to have lost interest half way and started asking annoying questions. Never heard back from them after that 1 call. Total ghosting :)|5/10|
|NextView Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. However, they rescheduled it on the day off the call. When we actually met, the partner disclaimed that they know very little about my space. They asked high level questions. Mid-way through their child walked into the meeting :) I honestly didn't mind it. Kids will be kids! But then the kid got on the nerves of the partner who lashed out their kid right in front of me. Ouch :( The partner was totally distracted from that point on. After a few days they got back promptly citing a legitimate sounding reason.|6/10|
|Ridge Ventures|Got connected quickly through a friend. The call was scheduled promptly. The partner was respectful and genuinely interested in learning about the startup. At the same time earnestly raised concerns about my market and it's ability to create winners. They followed up with an investment committe meeting. The meeting invite was awesome. It had the names of the attendees and their backgrounds in good detail so it saved me a ton of time researching each one of them. During the call, all of them were leaning in and genuinely interested in learning about the opportunity. They also challenged certain aspects but did it respectfully. Finally, they promptly followed up but without giving a reason. I requested to give some feedback and the partner setup a call! However, they did a no show on the call :)|9/10|
|SignalFire|They reached out by finding about the startup from the ""VC dark network"". The main contact was very excited after the first call. He followed up with a few questions and then setup a quick follow up with a couple other people. On the second call, the founding partner was suave and respectful. Although he didn't lean in much. A principal was hyper enthusiastic trying to impress his partners by asking awkwardly challenging questions. The main contact responded promptly with a reject and citing specific reasosn which was much appreciated.|9/10|
|Vertex|Call was scheduled promptly through a strong connection. Two partners showed up and both were great to interact with. They were genuinely trying to understand the business and evaluate the opportunity. Through the call it started to emerge that they didn't see it. But despite that they were respectful, cited their initial concerns. They did say that they will get back shortly with a more thoughtful reason. But they ghosted :) At least they were nice on the call!|7/10|
|Weekend Fund|Call was scheduled promptly. The partner was not familiar with the space but leaned in with decent questions. They said they would follow up. There was silence for several days but eventually got back. They claim to be pre-seed but they said they need more traction.|7/10|
|Zero Prime|The junior partner found the deal through the ""VC dark network"". Persisted and eventually we met. He was very enthusiastic and said will quickly follow up with a partner meeting. But then ghosted. No news ever again!|4/10|
|A16Z|Connected to a partner who was from my alma mater. First call was scheduled promptly. They were genuinely interested and asked good questions. They liked the space and the problem being addressed. They promised to follow up shortly. They did follow up citing genuine reasons.|8/10|
|HustleFund|Very frustrating and unclear process. They make you fill out a TypeForm form. Its quite an unwieldy way to fill out long pieces of text. It doesn't save your responses etc. Once I submitted they just sent a reject email in less than 24 hours :D What a fricking waste of time. They logged into the deck but didn't look beyond the title slide. So they didn't really evaluate it. Stay away!|2/10|
|Canaan|Scheduled promptly. Through the meeting didn't really engage and show genuine interest in learning about the statup. They were upfront that they do only companies with traction. So they should have not really even taken the meeting. They said they would get back shortly. But ghosted!!|4/10|
|Unusual Ventures|They were definitely on the bottom of my list. After submitting an online form they very eagerly and promptly setup a meeting based on the teams profiles. During the meeting, they were waiting for one of their main partners who joined late. That partner came totally unprepared and started off with a very condescending tone right of the bat. They were combative right from the beginning and just wanted to play Shark Tank - it seemed like it was entertainment for this partner. I told him that I have already heard that you didn't like this deal and hinted that we don't need to talk any further. Through the back channel later heard that that partner is quite toxic. Stay away!|1/10|
|Boldstart Ventures|Approached them through a warm contact. They didn't take a meeting citing their genuine position on my market - they don't invest in my market. Respect to them for saving everyone's time.|7/10|
|Costanoa|Another one towards the bottom of my list. It was easy to get in touch through a warm intro and the call was scheduled promptly. Two people joined - one was a partner, it wasn't clear what the other person was. This other person was a new member on the firm. They started of asking questions to stump you. There was barely any indication of a genuine effort in understanding the business. The body language was very poor. It felt condescending. They said they would get back in 2 to 4 weeks, but they never got back.|3/10|
|Felicis|The partner scheduled time promptly, asked insighftul questions, gave clarity on next steps. After a few days responded with a thoughtful email citing their reasons. Well done! High points for overall professional engagement.|9/10|
|Array VC|This one was also on the bottom of my list. The partner does not reply to emails promptly. And when they replied they were short half sentence emails - lack of genuine interest/professionalism. They claim they are focused on data &amp; analytics. So I thought they would be genuinely interested. But they didn't go beyond email interactions.|2/10|
|Wing Venture Capital|They comfortably found the link to my deck through the ""VC dark network"", went through it without permission, probably didn't like the deal and never even contacted me. It felt very disrespectful that they just went to the deck though they were not explicitly given access to it. Shady!!|2/10|
|Wave Capital|Conneced through a friend, very nice guy. Thoughtful and attentive. Not a market fit as they are into marketplaces. But still offered to connect to their network.|8/10|
|Afore Capital|In the bottom half of my list. I connected with a partner through a warm connection. But without even responding to me an associate took over. The associate set up a 20 minute meeting!! And for that they showed up 10 minutes late. So after a 15 min evaluation from a recent grad my startup got rejected. Wow! I am sure they spoilt with good deals.|3/10|
|GGV (Notable)|They took the meeting promptly. However, there was not much interest in engaging when they were on the call. They said they would get back, but they never did. Why do their waste their own time (and mine!)|4/10|

|Lerer Hippeau|Connected through a friend and was promptly scheduled for a meeting with an associate. The associate was very nice and engaged with inquisitive questions. He set up a follow on with one of the main partners. The main partner, however, was not very engaged he had made up his mind a few minutes into the call that this is not a deal he likes, which is fine. He said he'll get back with some feedback. Couple of days later they got back with some feedback.|8/10|
|Emergent VC|Got connected to them through a friend. The partner requested for updates over email. Sent them all the updates but the partner never even replied to the email. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Ovo Ventures|Easy to schedule with them, met them through a warm connection. The partner met and asked great questions and it was a good lively discussion. They did make it clear what the concerns were during the meeting. And then very promptly followed back, citing their reasons honestly. Very respecttful &amp; professional!|9/10|
|Kearney Jackson|Met them through a warm connection and the meeting was set up pretty quickly. Both the partners showed up and engaged very actively asked great questions. It felt like I learned something. They got back promptly, giving genuine reasons. Very professional great performance would work with them .|9/10|
|Nexus|Met them through a warm connection and a meeting was set up promptly. The partner was very curious and fully engaged. The meeting was in person. After going through the business, he was upfront that he didn't see a good market opportunity. But was classy in the way he said that. He did say he would follow up, but he never did.|7/10|
|Lightspeed Venture Partners|This was again through a warm connection and the meeting was set up promptly. The partner was engaged, although it wasn't clear how much he really understood. He did ask for some time to evaluate the business. He got back after a few days in a professional manner. No real complaints but wasn't impressive.|7/10|
|Montavista|I sent an email directly to the main partner who is from the same alma matter as me. They responded quickly and scheduled  time for an in person meeting along with the partnership. Everybody showed up on time. They had six people on the call. Three in the room with me and three on a Zoom call. Couple of them has great genuine questions and wanted to understand the opportunity. However, one person was very annoying, trying to put me down several times. It seemed they were trying to justify their value to the partnership by saying things like ""I can connect you with this big guy or that big guy"". The main partner, however, was awesome. He got back promptly citing his reasons for rejection.|7/10|
|Altos Ventures|Met the partner through a warm referral. They suggested an in person meeting. However, they don't have any parking around there which made it stressful. Also, it was far away from where I live so it was too much time commitment. And what made it more annoying was that within the first two minutes we established that they don't do preseed and seed stage investments. I wish they had just done a zoom call before an in-person. To their credit the partner was very nice and we had a good debate around the pros and cons of my startup strategy.|6/10|
|ENIAC VC|Got an intro into the firm from a warm referral. However, the email responses were very slow and when they did respond, the scheduler did not set up a meeting. I had to send a reminder to get the meeting scheduled. The partner who I met with did not really lean in. They said they would get back with next steps, but never did. Ghosted!|4/10|
|Foundation Capital|Got connected to them through a warm referral. In fact, foundation wanted to meet with me. However, when we connected they scheduled a meeting three weeks out! And on the day of the meeting, they rescheduled it. And then on the day of the meeting, the partner said that they would be taking the call on voice while driving. The audio was terrible. During the meeting, the partner was condescending. The saving grace was that the partner was smart and direct which I totally appreciate. But they were disrespectful which I totally don't appreciate.|4/10|
|Peak XV|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled two weeks out! When we met, one partner was still driving to work and the other partner was running behind. They did engage actively and showed genuine interest in the problem space. They said they would evaluate the market and get back for next steps. But I never heard back. Ghosted!|5/10|
|Village Global|Got connected through a warm referral. The meeting was scheduled promptly. I had to reschedule the first meeting because of an emergency. But the partner was very respectful and promptly accepted the reschedule. When we met, we established that they are from my industry. That really made the conversation engaging and meaningful. They got the idea! They followed back with very good questions. They also set clear expectations about the timeline for a decision.|8/10|
|Swift Ventures|They reached out to me by finding about me through the ""VC dark network"". The meeting was set up promptly, and one of the main partners attended. The discussion was decent. The partner was humble. But knew very little about my space. I thought it was a no-go I did not bother to follow up. But they followed up a few days later asking for my deck to have a clear closure. I sent the deck and a few hours later they got back stating their reasons for not going through.

1hci1oy,Freelance/Task Platform MVP Without an Escrow System?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice from entrepreneurs, developers, and experts who’ve worked on building platforms or MVPs.

I’m based in Ethiopia, where platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit have a huge untapped market but also face unique barriers. My goal is to create a platform tailored to my country, solving challenges like:

Payment Systems: Most Ethiopians don’t have access to international payment platforms like PayPal.

Language Barrier: Many don’t speak fluent English to navigate these global platforms.

Task Complexity: Many tasks on these platforms require high-level skills. I want to focus on simple, delegatable tasks, both digital and physical.


My Plan

I’m starting small with an MVP to validate the idea. Initially, I planned to use a Telegram bot interlinked with channels to mimic the platform experience. The idea was:

Users could find and post tasks for free (no commissions).

The bot would handle task assignments and communication.

Tasks would be split into digital (simple remote tasks like trimming videos or translating text) and physical (local jobs like delivering items or assembling furniture).


However, I hit a major roadblock:
I need an escrow system to build trust between users. But to integrate with Ethiopia’s banking system, I’d need:

A registered business

A trade license

A physical office, etc.


This requires upfront money (~$2000), which I don’t have.

My Question

How can I build an MVP that attracts users without an escrow system?

Are there ways to create trust and security without formal escrow?

Can I simplify the platform further to avoid needing banking integration?

Should I pivot to a different MVP idea that requires fewer resources?


I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. If anyone has tackled similar challenges, your advice would be invaluable.

1hbxxpd,How I run customer interviews (and why they're better than analytics for 0-1),"## Why talk to customers?

Look, I've built products at companies of all sizes - tiny startups, growing scale-ups, and 500-person enterprises. The one thing that's always worked? Actually talking to customers. Especially when you're starting from scratch.

Don't get me wrong - tools like Amplitude are great at showing you what people do in your app. But they miss everything that happens outside it. Some of the best insights I've found came from discovering that people were using weird Excel templates or Word docs as workarounds. You'd never catch that in your analytics.

## Getting good at interviews isn't hard

A lot of people get nervous about customer interviews. I get it - talking to strangers can be awkward. But honestly? It comes down to a few simple techniques that anyone can learn. Here's what works for me when I'm trying to understand customer problems.

## The techniques that actually work

### Ask questions that let people ramble

The best insights come when you let people tell their stories. Instead of asking ""Do you use Excel for this?"" (which just gets you a yes/no), ask ""How do you handle this today?"" Then shut up and listen.

### Repeat stuff back to them

This one's surprisingly powerful. When someone spends five minutes explaining their process, just summarize it back: ""So what you're saying is...?""

Two things happen:
1. If you misunderstood something (which happens all the time), they'll correct you
2. They often remember important details they forgot to mention

### Go down rabbit holes

Some of the best stuff comes from completely random tangents. When someone mentions something interesting, keep pulling that thread. Keep asking why. I've had calls where we went totally off-topic and found way bigger problems than what we originally wanted to talk about.

## How to run the actual call

### First five minutes

I always start the same way:

""Hey, thanks for jumping on. We've got 30 minutes - that still work for you? Cool. I wanted to talk about [topic]. You might have other stuff you want to ask about, but let's save that for the end if we have time. That sound okay?""

Simple, but it:
- Makes sure they're not running off to another meeting in 10 minutes
- Keeps things focused
- Lets them know they'll get to ask their questions too

### Diving into the conversation

Here's the thing about good interviews - they should feel like natural conversations, not interrogations. Start as wide as possible. I usually kick off with something super open-ended like ""Tell me about how you handle [whatever process] today.""

Then just listen. Like, really listen. When they mention something interesting, that's your cue to dig deeper. Say they mention ""Yeah, it's frustrating because I have to copy stuff between systems."" Don't just note that down and move on. That's gold! Follow up with ""Tell me more about that. What are you copying? Where from? Where to?""

The best stuff often comes from these diving-deeper moments. Maybe you'll discover they spend two hours every Friday copying data from their ticketing system into Excel because the reporting sucks. That's the kind of insight you can actually do something with.

Sometimes the conversation will hit a natural lull. That's when you pull from your question bank. But don't rush to fill every silence. Some of the best insights come right after those slightly awkward pauses when people remember ""Oh yeah, and there's this other thing that drives me crazy...""

### Questions I keep handy

Instead of a strict script, I keep a list of reliable questions I can throw in when needed:

- ""How do you deal with this right now?""
- ""On a scale of 1-10, how annoying is this problem?""
- ""What's an even bigger pain in your day?""
- ""Tell me about the last time this came up""
- ""Do you use any other tools for this? Excel? Word?""
- ""If you could wave a magic wand, how would this work?""

Don't treat these like a checklist. They're just there for when the conversation hits a wall or you need to dig deeper into something interesting.

### How to keep it flowing

1. Start really broad. Let them talk about their day, their problems, whatever's on their mind.

2. When they mention something painful, dig into it.

3. Sometimes asking about the same thing different ways helps. People might not realize they're using a workaround until you specifically mention spreadsheets or sticky notes.

4. Save the ""magic wand"" question for last. By then they've thought through all their problems and can better imagine solutions.

## Stuff that kills good interviews

1. **Asking leading questions**: Don't say ""Wouldn't it be better if..."" Just ask ""How would you improve this?""

2. **Trying to sell**: You're there to learn, not pitch. Save the product talk.

3. **Sticking too hard to your questions**: If they start talking about something interesting, follow that instead.

4. **Not recording**: Always ask if you can record. You'll miss stuff in your notes, and sometimes you need to hear exactly how they said something.

## Why this matters

Here's the thing: Analytics can tell you what users do, but only interviews tell you why. The best products I've worked on started with stuff I never would have found in analytics. They came from actual conversations where I shut up and let people tell me about their weird workarounds and daily frustrations.

Sure, it takes time. Yes, it can be awkward. But it works better than anything else I've tried.",39,startups,1733935901.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbxxpd/how_i_run_customer_interviews_and_why_theyre/

1hcfpwh,Turning a Dream into Reality: Seeking Support to Empower Thousands in Ethiopia,"Hi everyone,

I’m a dreamer from Ethiopia, a country where opportunities are hard to come by, but dreams still thrive. I’m working on building something that could change lives—not just mine, but countless others in my community. It’s a platform that seamlessly connects task creators with task doers. Imagine waking up stressed about money, without a job, or being a student needing quick income. My platform would let anyone with a laptop or phone find simple, quick tasks they can complete remotely—whether it’s a 2-hour gig or a one-day job. No hassle, no stress, just a way to make legitimate money right from your bed.

This isn’t just a website to me; it’s my passion and my purpose. I want to create a credible, seamless, and addictive platform that gives people a chance to thrive. For many here, $2,000 might not seem like much, but in Ethiopia, it’s a fortune. It’s the one barrier stopping me from making this vision a reality.

Sadly, platforms like GoFundMe and Kickstarter don’t work in my region, and finding funding locally is almost impossible. So, I’m reaching out directly to anyone out there who believes in the power of ideas and the impact one person can make. I know this idea has the potential to transform lives, to take people from feeling stuck to feeling empowered.

If you’ve ever had a dream you believed in with your whole heart but just didn’t have the resources to bring it to life, you know how I feel. I need $2,000 to get started, and I promise this isn’t just about me. It’s about building a system that helps people in my country find dignity, opportunity, and hope in the simplest way.

If you can support me or even share this message, you’re not just helping me; you’re becoming part of a journey to create something bigger than both of us. One person’s trash is another person’s gold, and this dream is my gold.

Thank you for reading and for believing in someone you’ve never met. Sometimes, all it takes is one act of kindness to change a life—and maybe many lives.",0,startups,1733987830.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hcfpwh/turning_a_dream_into_reality_seeking_support_to/

The number of shares will be pegged at the valuation of the next funding round, which is set to occur fairly soon.

When seeking innovative countries to invest in startups, how does a country like Switzerland outpace, for example, Brazil in innovation? Switzerland’s culture feels notably risk-averse compared to Brazil, which is loaded with creativity and faces numerous basic challenges to address. However, one country produces far more innovations than the other, leading me to conclude that innovation might rely more heavily on government policies and systems than on the will or culture of the people.

I recently added two integrations to my platform and worked with both to co-market our new collaborations - it went super well.

We shared a percentage of our user base with each other, overlapped our audience and grew on social media, added value props to our own platforms, and built out a little ecosystem where users just stay within our apps instead of going somewhere else.

1hc01id,Product and Message Differentiation is everything. Here's how I find both ,"**Introduction:** 

Great messaging is essential. Your message is the first thing anyone hears, reads, or sees about your business. It’s your elevator pitch, business card, tagline, and more all rolled into one.

Differentiated messaging — the only kind that really matters — is even more important. It not only conveys who you are, but who your target customers are and how you help them in a way your competitors can’t.

If done well, differentiated messaging helps every part of your organization level up:

* **Marketing** understands *who* you want to reach and *how* your company alone can help them. The team writes better copy, creates more effective campaigns, and builds an inbound machine filled with great prospects.
* **Sales** understands marketing’s *who* and *how*, but is also armed with a cheat code that helps them thrive in any competitive conversation they encounter.
* **Product** gets a clearer understanding of your advantage in the eyes of your customers (as opposed to their minds) and doubles down on what buyers care about most and can make smart investment and roadmap decisions.

Without a solid differentiated foundation, you and your teams suffer from:

* **Confusion**: What exactly does your company offer that’s special and why do customers care?
* **Low-confidence:** How do we talk about our product and business? Are these campaigns and talk tracks likely to work? What do we build? Who do we pursue?
* **Second-guessing and bad suggestions:** Without doing the hard work of figuring out how you're unique and valuable (i.e. differentiated), every mediocre idea gets considered, every good idea is prone to second-guessing. You waste time, energy, and enthusiasm.

You need to do the work to set a foundation and execute.

The good news: None of the above is that difficult to overcome. With a little knowledge of your competitors, product, and customers, you can create great differentiated messaging. 

All it takes is the right framework and some time.

**A few useful definitions:** 

* **Differentiator:**A characteristic of your firm that separates you from key competitors and gives you a perceived advantage in the eyes of your target customers
   * Key Elements: 
      * Entire firm, not just the product
      * Key competitors, not every competitor
      * Customer focus  
* **Messaging:**The key concepts you want a prospect to know about your company. What do you provide? How do you provide it? What value do customers receive? Messaging is the foundation that supports effective marketing, copywriting, campaigns, sales conversations, and more.  
* **Differentiated Messaging:**This is the unique message and story that only you can tell because of the product and company you’ve built and customers you serve. It tells prospects how you’re uniquely valuable to them and how you alone can help achieve a particular outcome. Differentiated messaging should be your marketing team’s holy grail and first priority before writing a website, one-pager, case study, or any other piece of collateral.

**Step 1: Get Smart**

You’re going to have a very hard time telling a compelling story about your business if you don’t understand your product, customers, and competitors, which are the Core Components of Differentiated Messaging.Founders *sometimes* know their product, customers, and competitors well enough to proceed straight to Step 2, but there are plenty of founders who have understandably confused themselves about who they serve well and why. They’re too in the weeds to be effective marketers. 

Other leaders — CMOs, sales and product leaders, and product marketers — will need to partner across teams to make sure they’ve got the requisite knowledge to have a fruitful discussion.The idea is to know each of the Core Components as a team. A single individual doesn’t need all of this knowledge, but across a team, you need to know product, customers, and competitors. 

In general you should know (or get to know) your:

* Customers: 
   * Firmographics: What types of businesses have you sold to in the past? Consider industry, team size and composition, revenue, geography, tech stack, and customer base. This will help you develop a hypothesis about which potential segments you serve best.
   * Buyers: Who within a firm do you sell to most often? What persona? Who else is in the buyer map?
   * Problems: What problems are the companies you serve facing? What are they trying to accomplish?
   * Why you: The most difficult question to answer accurately is why customers chose you. Your sales conversations should give you an idea about why a customer chose you, but you may need to circle back and ask again. A decent win-loss program really helps here.

* Product: 
   * Features: You may have a technical product with a long list of features. It’s possible that 1-2 of these are a key differentiator.
   * Non-Product Attributes: While we tend to focus on features in technology, it’s likely that your customers value some other aspect of your firm. The sales experience, delivery channel, customer service, industry expertise, and more are all possible differentiation factors. So while the product gets the most attention, be sure to think beyond the software.  
* Competitors: 
   * It’s easy to go too deep on your competitors. You can easily consider too many competitors and think too much about their features, customers, investors, marketing and more. Instead, focus on the three competitors you see most often in deals, and focus on their marketing. Limit your research here competitors’ websites and five most recent blog posts and press releases. You’ll need to consume this marketing with a critical eye. Look for what they’re saying and *what they’re not saying*.

**Step 2: Structured Workshop With Your Team**

This is the crux.

Of the three steps, this workshop is the one that has the biggest potential impact. If done well you’ll surface useful disagreements, compelling insights, unique perspectives, and come to consensus on what matters most. It uncovers facts, drives alignment, and helps win buy-in, all of which are keys to a successful messaging project.

I use a framework called MUD, which I learned from a very smart colleague. MUD is an acronym for:

* Meaningful: Can we charge money for this attribute?
* Unique: Do we alone offer it? Can our target customers get the same thing elsewhere?
* Defensible: Can we prove what we claim with data or testimonials?

Here’s the workshop process:

1. **Discuss potential differentiators as a group**This isn’t quite a brainstorm, but it is a broad discussion about your business and customers. You want to encourage people to consider the business broadly and think beyond mere product features — remember the elements of a differentiator in the definition above.You’ll notice the same ideas surfacing again and again from slightly different angles, with slightly different emphases. That’s great! Let the ideas and opinions flow during this portion of the discussion. That said, it’s helpful if you can combine similar ideas to points that have already been made, as it makes subsequent steps easier. An experienced facilitator can really help here.Depending on your product and market, you should generate a list of 10-30 potential differentiators.  
2. **Evaluate based on MUD**With a list of 20-30 potential differentiators in hand, you then evaluate them based on the MUD framework.Go down your list and ask yourselves if each is Meaningful (will someone pay for this attribute), Unique (you alone offer it), and Defensible (can you prove it). Be very honest. The temptation to fudge is strong, especially when you’re discussing Uniqueness, but being soft here will hurt in the long run. Again, an experienced facilitator can help you navigate tough questions and commit to ideas with promise.The MUD process should hone your imprecise list of 20-30 potential differentiators down to 3-5 well-articulated, high-quality attributes that you can share confidently with your team, prospects, and customers.

**Step 3: Refine results to craft a compelling story**

A workshop alone won’t lead to clear and compelling differentiators. You’ll need a team of articulate colleagues to make your differentiators shine and to highlight the value that each delivers. Spend time with a colleague or two to refine what you created in the workshop and highlight the value each delivers for your target customers.You should seek to use each of your differentiators as a pillar that supports a compelling story about your customer, product, and market. And that story should lead customers directly to one solution … yours.

1hbsxn7,Are you pivoting after a negative pitch?,"Hi all,

so my co founder and me (I am the IT guy) just had our first real pitch to a potential pilot customer. We are working on a platform where users are able to buy services. The niche is not very digital yet. 
So we presented our idea and he said that it will not work because they will always use the payment and redemption options in their existing POS provider. They are also working on some local apps to have it more digital and don't need an overall platform, because we will not be able to onboard all other businesses. 
So we are asking ourselves now if we need to pivot on some main features or not. Our app will be much better for the enduser, but if we don't have businesses on our platform it will not help. An integration to the POS systems would be great, but to expensive at the beginning. We wanted to handle the payments here and redeem the products via QR Codes in the beginning. I still think we have a great solution, but he said we should change the area for our business.

So are you pivoting some features after every feedback or do you evaluate the feedback and then continue working on the general product?

1hbrl60,3 Key Elements of a High-Converting Web App MVP 🚀,"As someone who builds MVPs as a part of my daily job, I’ve learned a lot about what works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to creating impactful web applications. Here are three things I always keep in mind:

1️⃣ **Simplicity is Key:** Your MVP isn’t meant to be feature-packed. Focus on the **core problem** you’re solving and implement just enough functionality to validate your idea. Adding too many features early can overwhelm users and delay launch.

2️⃣ **User Feedback Drives Growth:** The first version isn’t perfect—and it shouldn’t be. Launch early, then use **real feedback from users** to guide the next steps. Tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics can help you understand user behavior.

3️⃣ **Landing Pages Matter:** Your app is only half the battle. A clear, well-designed landing page with strong CTAs can significantly improve conversions. Highlight the benefits over features, and keep the design clean to avoid cognitive overload. A Good looking landing page &amp; a high conversion landing page are two diff things.

If you’re a founder working on an idea or struggling with getting your MVP to market, feel free to share your challenges in the comments. I’d be happy to brainstorm ideas or offer advice. Let’s help each other build something great!

1hbz0xm,Worth Building this SAAS?,"I'm working on a SAAS which takes your content and localizes it, this includes translation with lipsyncing, using your own voice for dubbing etc.. as well as channel creation and automatic uploading. So you can link your youtube channel, select ""Spanish"" and the channel will be created and automatically go through the localization and uploading process every time you upload to your main channel, hence expanding your viewership/brand/revenue.

This will be available for Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter etc..

The main pushback against this is product is that Youtube is starting to add an ""Audio Track"" setting that enables automatic dubbing for your channel. The problem with relying solely on this Youtube feature for localization is that

1. It's being rolled out slowly and only available for a small amount of creators.
2. Even when dubbing is added it's unnatural because of the unsynced lips
3. Dubbing takes away the personal connection you create with your actual voice/brand recognition and uses a generic sound that is probably assigned to every other channel.
4. This may be incorrect but I've read that mixing your channel demographics from different countries can lower the ad rates for US based channels which have the highest rate. So if users start watching dubbed spanish and your main user base starts to shift from the US to say Brazil, then the revenue you generate will start decreasing opposed to keeping a purely US based rate.
5. While other platforms may start to push out dubbing sometime soon, right now only Youtube has just started to do it and trying to implement the other features such as using your own voice for dubbing at the scale Youtube has to deal with will be nearly impossible for a long time.

1hbkqyi,Llama is better? My client insists on Claude for building an AI Agent,"I’m working on a project where I need to build an AI agent for a client. As someone who has evaluated different models, I genuinely believe LLaMA (especially its recent iterations) is better for the job. Here’s why:
	1.	Customization: LLaMA is open-weight, which means I have far greater flexibility to fine-tune and tailor it for the specific use case. This level of control is perfect for creating a specialized agent.
	2.	Cost-Efficiency: Hosting LLaMA locally or on dedicated infrastructure can save significantly in the long term compared to relying on Claude’s API pricing structure.
	3.	Performance: Depending on the task, LLaMA has shown better accuracy and reasoning capabilities in many benchmarks. It also has a more robust architecture for handling nuanced instructions when properly fine-tuned.
	4.	Privacy: Since LLaMA can run on custom infrastructure, I can ensure data security and privacy, which is a big concern for many businesses these days.

However, my client is adamant about using Claude. I get it—it’s user-friendly, has a solid API, and works great out of the box for many general-purpose applications. But I feel like Claude’s closed ecosystem and less customizable nature might limit the long-term potential of the AI agent we’re building.

Am I wrong for pushing back on this? Has anyone else faced a similar situation where the client insists on a tool that you know isn’t the best fit? Would love to hear your thoughts on navigating this!

I have a tech background and have blasted through building an MVP/prototype that shows off my idea concept, it took about 5 weeks. I'm trying to build interest and 75% of the time people respond positively (if they reply),  A handful of people have reached out asking to try it free of charge and but I haven't received any feedback yet. I have been reaching out to people via LinkedIn private messaging and reddit forums.

My idea is healthcare-related and I get the impression that many people in the industry are just overworked and don't have time nor motivation to try out my solution. They need an incentive, I am basically saying ""*hey, I made a thing, please can you try it for me AND let me know what you think for free???*"", it is a shock to me that people are even saying yes to this.

I don't know how to give that incentive to them without scaling the product, but then it would be foolish to scale a product that hasn't been validated, no?

1hbux45,I’ve built an AI website builder and it’s free to use,"
So, at the start of this year, I had the idea to develop a free website builder for small business owners using Al, saving them months of stress and thousands in design costs.

Brands such as Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace are great, but they still required a certain level of skill to use and also took a decent amount of time to complete a website. We realised most business owners don't have this time and definitely didn't want to spend thousands on a new website. 

Our mission was to put an end on this completely.

So, we developed an AI website builder which we believe is the best in the market (after testing and paying attention to others)

Here’s how the platform works:
- AI does the heavy lifting: use it to design unlimited amounts of websites in seconds, or choose from 200+ professionally designed templates. 
- Not confident with tech? No worries, you can schedule a free 1-on-1 website setup call where we’ll design the website for you. (Basically, you’re getting a free web designer- no stress or hidden fees)
- Plus, our websites are easy to manage, you can do any updates yourself, anytime, without paying a penny more. And we have an online course with answers to all topics. 

This AI website builder has been developed all year and we’re now wanting more people to test it out for themselves, and to also gauge the interest from people - although we did reach 6K followers from pre launch ads! (Humble brag)

Right now, we’re working with service based businesses only, as we don’t want to burden ourselves with e-commerce functionality at the start, although we do have this as an option, it just requires some extra coding.

If you’re wondering how we’re offering this service for free, our platform offers website hosting and we also have a marketing agency so developing these connections will only help us work with the next big upcoming businesses. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
- Does this sound like something you or a small business owner you know would use?

1hbch7r,Do we need a co-founder or an employee?,"Hi,

We're a B2C startup that just surpassed $12k MRR, bootstrapped, and we're also doing a spinoff - a B2B product that grew from a personal pain point we experienced while growing our B2C business through SEO. We have some early traction with B2B, but B2C remains our primary source of revenue.

We've also raised a very small FFF round to accelerate our growth. We're a very small team at the moment, just two brothers as co-founders. I'm the CEO/CTO, technical, write code and sell, with lots of experience from working at YC and big tech. My brother is non-technical, a CPO/CMO blend, responsible for marketing, product, operations, and customer support. We also have two hired people: a content marketer and a software engineer.

Our blind spots are structure, project management, and strategy. We all hate routine and project management. I feel a need for someone to step into a role to help us ""get organized.""

A friend of mine organically approached us and made himself useful on several fronts. He helped us think through our goals and financial projections. He's really good with data, holds a PhD in computer science, but he's more of a Data Science person. We also get along very well (I've known him for 10 years now but never worked on any substantial project together). He's also remote. I'm in SF, my brother's in Warsaw, and he's in Amsterdam.

Now we want to make a decision about whether to make him an offer as a co-founder. Help me think this through. Here are the questions I've asked myself so far:

1. Would this person increase the probability of success for this company? Yes, I think he will. But maybe if I looked more intentionally, I'd find someone who would accelerate us even faster. I'm not sure.
2. Can I hire this person? No, I can't. His salary is north of $300k yearly, and we wouldn't be able to afford that.
3. Are his skills complementary to ours? Yes, he has much better presentation skills than anyone in our group. He also has a PhD, which looks good on paper and will attract better talent.
4. Do we get along? Yes, I feel comfortable in his presence and would love to hang out together.

His role would be something like chief of staff, plus he could help with engineering.

Now, I know this is a lot of words, but what questions should I ask myself before making him a co-founder or deciding otherwise?",3,startups,1733865216.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbch7r/do_we_need_a_cofounder_or_an_employee/
1hb7bu8,Should I Quit My Job to Pursue My Startup Idea?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads and could really use some advice. I work as an staff applied research scientist in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and during my job, I’ve identified a significant problem in the process of data generation for RAG systems. I’ve come up with an idea that I believe can solve this problem effectively—not just for my current company but for any organization that relies on document-based systems.

Here’s the situation:
- The idea is not specific to my company; it’s a general solution that could benefit various industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.

- I haven’t built anything yet, but I’ve started planning the product and am confident it could work.

- My current employment contract likely restricts me from working on side projects without disclosure.

I’m torn between two options:
- Stay at my job and work on the idea as a side project: This would allow me to validate the idea without taking a big financial risk. However, it feels slow, and I’m concerned about any potential conflict with my employer.

- Quit my job and go all-in on the startup: This would give me the freedom to focus entirely on the idea, but it’s a big leap, and I’d need to rely on my savings until the startup gains traction.

For context:
- I have savings to support myself (single no kids) for a 1 year.

- I’m passionate about solving this problem and feel this idea has real potential.

- I want to act ethically and ensure I’m not violating any legal agreements.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should I quit my job and take the risk, or try to balance both until the idea gains traction?

Any advice, experiences, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1hbnnwg,How to Crush Facebook Ads with a Small Budget,"Running Facebook ads successfully with a small budget is not only possible but often recommended for new advertisers. Starting small allows you to minimize financial risk while learning the platform and optimizing campaigns. Here's a step-by-step guide to maximizing results on a tight budget.

# Defining a Small Budget

* **Small Budget**: Less than $3,300 per month (\~$100/day).
* **Tiny Budget**: Less than $600 per month (\~$20/day).

Starting small is wise because initial campaigns might not perform well. Once profitable, you can scale confidently.

# 1. Copy What Works Best in Your Industry

With limited funds, avoid testing too many variables. Instead:

* Use the **Meta Ads Library** (free tool) to analyze competitors' ads.
* Focus on ads that have been running for months; these are likely successful.
* Model your ads on these examples, including style, format, and language, but avoid outright copying.

Shortcut your success by leveraging others' testing efforts.

# 2. Reduce the Number of Variables

* Focus on selling **one product or service** at a time, preferably:
   * Your best-selling item.
   * The item with the highest profit margin.
* Keep campaigns simple with fewer ad sets and ads.

This approach helps Meta gather sufficient data and optimizes performance faster.

# 3. Trust Meta’s Algorithms

Rely on tools like **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns** or **Advantage+ Audiences** to let Meta optimize targeting and placement. Avoid experimental tactics that could risk your small budget.

Meta’s systems are designed to deliver results, especially when campaigns align with platform recommendations.

# 4. Be Willing to Spend More on Conversions

Set realistic expectations for return on ad spend (ROAS):

* For beginners, aiming for a **2x–4x ROAS** is reasonable.
* Aggressively spend up to your break-even point to gain initial customers.

The goal is not immediate profitability but scaling, gathering conversion data, and building brand awareness for long-term success.

# 5. Avoid Brand Awareness Campaigns

For small budgets:

* Focus on **lead generation** or **sales campaigns**.
* Avoid vague objectives like ""getting your business out there.""

Exception: **Omnipresent content strategies** can work for small audiences but are niche-specific.

# 6. Avoid Constantly Tweaking Campaigns

Frequent adjustments reset the **learning phase**, hindering optimization. To maximize success:

* Allow campaigns to run for a sufficient period to gather data.
* Adjust based on **conversion volume**, not arbitrary timeframes.

Smaller budgets mean longer learning phases, so patience is key.

# 7. Niche Down Your Audience

Target a specific subsection of your market to:

* Tailor messaging effectively.
* Stand out from generic ads targeting broad audiences.

For example, instead of marketing broadly, position yourself as a specialist in a specific industry, like SaaS businesses. Expand gradually as you scale.

# 8. Embrace New Features and Strategies

Leverage your small business agility by quickly adopting:

* New Meta features.
* Innovative ad strategies.

Larger companies often move slower due to complex decision-making processes, giving smaller advertisers a competitive advantage.

# Conclusion

Running Facebook ads with a small budget requires strategic planning and patience. By focusing on what works, trusting Meta’s tools, and avoiding common pitfalls, you can achieve success and scale your campaigns over time. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your results grow.",0,startups,1733899607.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbnnwg/how_to_crush_facebook_ads_with_a_small_budget/

my cofounder and i are 2-man team. he is the tech and i am the marketing/growth. i came up with the idea last week, pitched it to him, he built it in 2 days, and we dropped it. no posts on reddit, no paid ads, no influencers or creators, just by asking and making friends. our goal for this specific project is to grow and build a community around it. it aint gonna make us millions but what's valuable is the platform and users we'll be able to reach.

here are few tips to tech founders who lack marketing and sales:

\- build a brand or build a persona online but have a presence

\- interact with soon to be users/customers ahead of time but don't give off corporate/sales vibes, make friends

\- build relationships with your users ahead of time, months ahead ideally but weeks works.

\- always ask, the worst thing a person can say is ""no"", don't be afraid of rejection or being ignored or ghosted

these tips would be your generic tips for any startup, depending on the industry and audience, u'd have to think outside the box.

1hbn3hx,Idea Validation - Ever spent hours wrestling with data from a PDF or invoice? ,"You know the drill: someone sends you a file, and suddenly it’s *your job* to extract all the data manually. Copy-pasting, fixing formatting issues, and double-checking everything. By the time you’re done, you’re wondering why it felt like such a monumental waste of time.

I’ve been there. And honestly? It’s what inspired me to start building a solution.

Here’s the idea:  
Imagine a tool where you can upload *any* document—PDFs, invoices, contracts, whatever—and it extracts all the important data into a clean, editable table in seconds no OCR training effort required, you just tell what you want to extract regardless of the format and it does it for you.

But that’s not all. You could:

* Edit or add custom notes/fields right there.
* Automate the next steps (send data to your CRM, shoot off an email, etc.).
* Validate data through a custom API or save it directly into your database.

Basically, it’s about turning that painful grunt work into an automated workflow. No coding. No headaches. Just fast, clean data you can actually use.

Now, I would like to validate the idea, how do you guys feel about this?

1hbdfhb,5 ways content marketing has changed over the last decade,"I've been in the digital marketing game since 2010, mostly focusing on startups and e-commerce. As I've been prepping to launch a new project, it’s striking just how much the industry has changed over the last decade—and how few of the tactics I would have employed in 2015 are even remotely relevant today.

And since one of my core marketing skills has always been wasting time on Reddit, I thought I’d put some of my thoughts together in a post to see if this tracks with other folks’ experiences.

Here are five ways I’ve seen content marketing evolve over the last decade. What did I miss?

**1. Organic social reach for written content has collapsed**

One of the first startups I worked with built a sizable audience on Facebook simply by creating and sharing fun, engaging blog content. At its peak, this company could post an intriguing blog link and consistently count on tens of thousands of clicks without spending any money on boosting it at all. This was the era of BuzzFeed quizzes, endless listicles, and content designed—for better or worse— to appease the clickbait gods.

But in the mid-to-late 2010s, Facebook introduced changes that completely killed this strategy. Organic reach for links was throttled, while content that kept users on the platform (like videos and native posts) was rewarded. Look up the infamous “pivot to video” for an illustration of how this impacted media brands. For more check out Cory Doctorow’s concept of “enshittification,” a pattern that continues to today.

**2. SEO Is more competitive, niche, and less gameable**

When I first started in marketing, the SEO playbook was riddled with black-hat tactics: keyword stuffing, low-effort link farms, duplicate sites—you name it. But then Google got hip and rolled out a series of algorithm updates that penalized low-quality tactics. Some clients I worked with lost half their SEO traffic overnight as various core algo updates rolled out.

Since then, Google has continued to bang the drum that all it wants is high-quality, useful content that fills the needs of the person searching. Of course, this is not a bad thing, and in-depth, original, and niche content that truly addresses search intent should be rewarded. What's challenging is that over this same period, it's become increasingly difficult to ""win"" at SEO as Google has stuffed its SERPs with ads and new features like those recent AI summaries. SEO remains one of the only viable content channels for startups, but in many ways, it's more competitive and more difficult than ever.

**3. Mobile-first everything**

Even the most professional UX designers (working as they do from their 27-inch monitors) can forget that most web traffic comes from mobile devices. It’s no longer enough for your site to be mobile-friendly—it has to be mobile-first. This has been as much of a change for marketers as it has been for devs and designers. After all, the experience that someone has when landing on mobile page can make or break every one of your marketing metrics and channels.  

**4. The ascent of vertical video**

If you're reading this, than you already know that the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels has fundamentally reshaped content consumption. Vertical video has become the dominant format, and its influence extends far beyond these platforms. Since these apps are more about keeping users on the app than driving them to external links. This shift forces marketers to rethink how they approach content creation. Instead of using social media as a referral engine, it’s all about building brand awareness and engaging directly with audiences. And even this has already started to become more difficult (see again, ""enshittification"").

**5. The AI revolution (and/or apocalypse)**

Finally, there’s the six-fingered elephant in the room: AI. The rise of tools like ChatGPT et al has already transformed content marketing workflows with new AI-driven tools cropping up every day. While we’re still in the early days of the AI revolution, it’s clear that this isn’t just a fad. AI will continue to reshape how marketers create, distribute, and measure content. I mean, I bet people are reading this post right now who think that it's AI-generated (I swear, it's not though I did use GPT to proofread).

1haw07b,Anyone else here have autism / auditory processing disorder (APD) and find going to parties and networking hard?,"I moved back to the bay area from CO primarily because I wanted to do another startup in the AI space.

The problem is I really forgot how much I hate networking and going to parties.

I also have auditory processing disorder (APD) which makes it much harder for me to have discussions in rooms when music is playing or lots of people are taking.

It effectively makes going to super cool events almost pointless to me.

Now I LOVE talking to smart people so if I can hear them I really enjoy it but it's usually in smaller meetings or when people are outside.  

The problem is that this is most of the events I go to.  It's just such a cacophony I can't really focus and just want to leave.

I thought maybe one strategy would be to organize my OWN events that I design to be ideal for me to hear. Like going for hikes or over dinner. Something like that.

1hbdz5s,$5.. forever? 😏,"👋🏼 Over the past year, I’ve been diving into software development and product management. Most of my projects have been ambitious and complex (read: nowhere near finished), so I decided to tackle something smaller to gain practical experience.

Recently, I needed to organize my finances for an upcoming move. Instead of creating yet another Google Sheet, I thought, Why not build a simple tool for myself? 🙃

What began as a quick personal project quickly escalated. In just a few days, I developed a full app, complete with a licensing system and a (barebones) marketing site. It’s been a fun learning journey, and it feels great to have something tangible out there instead of endlessly tinkering.

The app is straightforward—it’s an offline finance tool that stores data locally and helps plan finances without relying on bank integrations. While it’s not groundbreaking, it serves my needs and avoids the hassle of dealing with miscategorized transactions.

Here’s where I deviated from the norm: I opted for a $5 lifetime license instead of the typical subscription model. I understand that subscriptions are standard in SaaS, and this approach likely won’t make me rich. However, I wanted to experiment with simplicity and see if a one-time price could still attract interest.

So far, a few sales have come in, boosting my confidence. But I’m curious: Does this kind of pricing make sense for small, low-maintenance tools like this? Or am I missing the mark by not adopting the subscription model?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this pricing experiment and any similar experiences you’ve had. Thanks for reading!",0,startups,1733869091.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hbdz5s/5_forever/

We are in the early stages of iterating on a Personalised Health LLM and we have been testing it with target users via Google Meets. I've mostly been transcribing their feedback manually **as they speak**, but I rather be freeing up that 40% brain capacity, better interacting with them and asking them better follow-ups questions.

I tried Quicktime recording, to no avail as audio didn't come through for whatever reason. Any recs? I'd need the record the: 

* Meeting screen (ie Google Meet presenter's)
* My audio
* Tester's audio

Ideal Output: mp4/mov video and transcript. Gladly take a duct tape solution if I could keep cost zilch.

1hb3vc6,Customer Success software? ,"Hi!

I've noticed a lot of sales/CRM platforms work primarily on sales funnel and conversions; mostly to close deals. But I've been looking for 'post sales', basically making sure customers onboard properly, use the products the right way etc. I've worked in the past with a couple of larger, more mature startups who predominantly went with enterprise level customers and they're using jury-rigged CRMs to manage those relationships. So they make sure they're touching base with them and they essentially create new 'pipelines' and triggers to check in with a customer if they haven't in a while or if the customer makes a certain action.

I've found what I've been looking at is essentially account management and customer success, but there doesn't appear to many tools specifically for this area. Where they are they're looking purely at retention and churn rather than relationship building and upsell. Am I in a bit of a bubble because of the startups I've worked with, or is this just an area that doesn't get that much focus?",1,startups,1733843363.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hb3vc6/customer_success_software/

How is it different from competition ? 
I address one pain point specifically: Existing tools are complicated as sh*t. They not only provide 1000000 useless features, but the UI has a million different buttons doing a million different things and it is soooooooo overwhelming. 
I have tried to make my tool EXTREMELY simple. The UI is really soothing and I got good feedback for it.

1ha5uzg,These are the 27 books I have read in 2024 as a founder,"Hello founders,

The next step is pretty big. It involves selling my house to fund further prototyping, testing, manufacturing and getting ready for the launch.

1hafrv8,Your thoughts on fractional CXOs?,"I was a startup CTO (and co-founder) but after a long 8 year grind I decided to step down. Main reason: the company entered a new phase with main focus on sales and scaling with much less innovation. Came to a point where I simply felt done and started to hate my job.

Took the company from 0 to 1 and grew product and engineering teams from 3 to 40 people. After stepping down I got a handful of offers from other startups but politely declined and took a well-needed sabbatical. Wasn't mentally ready to commit to a new journey just yet. A fellow CTO friend suggested that I try consulting as Fractional CTO. Loved the idea and the flexibility but quickly noticed that the majority of smaller and early-stage startups had tiny budgets and were looking for a lead engineer and not a CTO. While I do love to code I also love to lead people and build teams and culture. 

I understand that you can't bring in a fractional CTO if your company already has a CTO but I also see many in this sub looking for a technical co-founder. In my head, a fractional CTO is the perfect candidate. It's the least risky way to try work together and see if there is personal chemistry and vibe. If we enjoy working together and I believe in the idea I would even strongly consider joining the team if offered. 

On to my question:

I am still figuring out my ICP and where to find the right people (Linkedin sucks ) and wanted to ask people here what their views on fractionals are in general. Have you worked with any? In what phase? If not, did you consider it? Why not?

Please share your honest thoughts, experiences, and of course, opinions!

1hao27x,Thoughts on this idea for a student-focused ticket marketplace?,"

Thoughts on this idea for a student ticket p2p


is is an (albeit not very original) small idea I've had over the past day, looking to see if it would be viable on a small scale.

Essentially, I'm a college student that's noticed that the ticket market is kinda fucked for alot of students, particularly for reselling and ticket exchanges, students often have to go through WhatsApp in groups, there are alot of scams, and it's not very secure.

the central idea of this is a student-centred p2p marketplace to buy, sell and exchange tickets for (mainly) student events. It could potentially partner with different student groups and societies on campuses, exclusive pre-sale access, possibly local venue partnerships as well, for student discounts of early-bird pricing. There would be price-caps to prevent extreme scalping, and two-factor authenticators using student ID to keep out fraudulent activity.

Revenue generation could come from a small transaction fees, subscription plans, advertising etc. 

There are alot of different ticket apps out there right now, what sets this idea apart is the focus on students and alleviate their specific pain-points. what do you think?",0,startups,1733787955.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hao27x/thoughts_on_this_idea_for_a_studentfocused_ticket/

I have been working at a startup for a couple of months as the founding engineer brought on. Our MVP has been built and started making money but there are no outside investors currently. I have done a significant amount of work on the backend for free due to having a personal relationship with one of the founders and it's more fun than my day job. I am trying to figure out what my expectations should be for equity now that the legal papers are finished.

We are currently bootstrapped and unsure if investors will be needed. The current equity situation has 25% designated for employees and investors - they want to give me 5-6% because they say that investors will be unlikely to invest if given more equity than this and that 5-6% is already triple the market value for equity for an employee (if we had any money to give me a salary as well).

I feel like because I am working for free and will probably be working for free for the next months / year currently that I should be in the range of 10-15%, but I got the sense that they thought this was unreasonable.

1hamrkm,startup ios name advice,"for context im building an ios app in a niche area and i came up with a pretty creative and name that i love - it’s directly related to the niche im building and its a simple but memorable name.

the only problem is that there is someone else in the same niche space who had a similar idea to me with the same name on the App Store. they seem like a small builder with a history of making two apps, but the app im talking about only has 2 reviews for stars and hasn’t been updated in over a year.

even though i am in the same space as the other app and planned to use the name in a fun unique way like the other app, my apps execution is completely different from design to function (even though they address the same problem)

im not that worried about the other app impacting my new apps search because even the other app doesn’t show up in the top 3 for its name - so if people love what I build im hoping my search results will be much better

my main issue right now is that I’ve fallen in love with the name. I came up with it when I first was building the app and now im really really disappointed a very small outdated app has the same one.

I know names don’t mean everything but this one I felt meant a lot as a ios app where the name is also tied to the meaning and ways to market / distribute the app.

there’s no trademark on the name I checked - would you recommend me still using the same name? I know apple has a strict policy but im hoping my execution and actual final product being much better and unique can be enough (especially since the other app hasn’t been updated or used much)

1ha6q7c,"Story about ""re-starting"" successful startup","I have been working on a startup related to 3D printer management. Over the last few years, this segment has changed a lot—new competitors have appeared, and we’re slowly achieving nice numbers in terms of users and new subscriptions.

A year ago, we realized that instead of focusing on creating precise solutions to integrate all 3D printers into our software, the real focus should be on the process itself—the workflow of how 3D models are created and prepared for printing. We always thought we needed to create an end-to-end solution, from the moment the 3D model is created to the time the printer starts working. But this is an incredibly complex problem as a whole, and not all parts of it need solving.

Our biggest target group right now is schools, where the process begins in the classroom with students and their projects. They create a model, send it for review to the teacher, schedule it for printing alongside others, and finally, it gets printed. Interestingly, the last part—the actual printing, which is the most difficult from a ""technical"" perspective—is the least important in the process.

We tried to implement all these steps into our application, but in the end, we built a very complex piece of software that didn’t solve the most critical parts of the workflow.

With all this in mind, I decided to leave this startup and start a new one, bringing with me all the experience and new perspectives I’ve gained. This time, I’m starting from the beginning—thinking before coding. I’m trying to adhere to all the concepts I know exist, but as someone ""over-experienced,"" I sometimes skipped steps in the past. Now, I’m learning to share my ideas publicly, I’ve created a ""signup waitlist"" page for my new startup, and I’m genuinely excited to see how things unfold.

This time, I want to truly enjoy the startup journey. I feel like I have more space, time, and the opportunity to do things properly. And who knows—maybe in the future, my ""old startup"" will evolve into the new one, solving old problems from a fresh perspective.

I just wanted to share this mindset change. It’s been incredibly liberating to leave behind the ""full bag"" that was weighing me down and embrace this ""light running.""",10,startups,1733739748.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ha6q7c/story_about_restarting_successful_startup/

 However, do you think it’s also common that they would value the team because they produced good work in the past, and could hopefully produce more good things/expand the application?  

I can see it being necessary to keep on some of the engineers to perform maintenance, train other staff, incorporate into the other company.  

The reason I’m asking this is because I’m trying to help understand how our current sass company can position itself for acquisition. My CEO seems to think that having the **potential** to solve more market problems (eg by leveraging the current platform, and because the team has a history of some innovative solutions) is something valuable.  Me on the other hand, I feel like the current platform with all his current abilities, is what the only real value that any potential buyer would care about.

1h9v6dj,Technical founder here - What's your take on outsourcing MVP development? How much would you pay?,"

Hey fellow founders,

As a technical founder who's been in the startup ecosystem for a while, I've noticed a significant rise in MVP development agencies. While I can code, I've been wondering about the general sentiment around outsourcing MVP development, especially given time constraints and the need to focus on other aspects of the business.

I'm curious:

1. Would you consider hiring someone to build your MVP, even as a technical founder? Why or why not?

2. The big question - what's your threshold for MVP development cost? What would you consider a reasonable budget for a solid MVP? (I'm seeing ranges from $5K to $50K+ and honestly not sure what's reasonable anymore)

Would love to hear from those who've gone this route:
- What did you pay?
- Was it worth it?
- Any regrets?

Also, if you chose NOT to outsource, I'd love to hear your reasoning.

P.S. Not looking to outsource right now, just trying to understand the market dynamics and what other founders think is a fair price point for MVP development.",47,startups,1733698334.0,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9v6dj/technical_founder_here_whats_your_take_on/
1hanls4,"Our New Facebook Ads Strategy that made us 7.5 ROAS
","Dude this was crazy!  
  
This is how we've been consistently generating 5-10 ultra qualified. leads per day for our SaaS using facebook ads and conditional logic  
  
We used to struggle because our ads tend to attract a lot of ""wannabe entrepreneurs"" that would sign up then cancel the next month because their business wasn't running yet  
  
Now we attract only people that already have a running business and are looking for a better tool to do their everyday priority tasks  
  
**First - The Ad creatives**  
  
You know, your Saas should be a better alternative to a pre-existing method of executing an everyday task   
  
The idea is: your customer needs to execute a few tasks everyday that are essential for the business to run  
  
Simple example: the uber driver has to drive towards the clients pickup spot  
  
Your Saas should be a superior tool when compared to the traditional method (example: chainsaw vs. hacksaw)  
  
Your facebook ad creative should be a video announcing the viewer that your tool exists and that you're capable of performing XYZ tasks faster and/or cheaper. That's it.  
  
Try to use an instagram Reel format.   
  
**Second - The ad form**  
  
Our biggest shift here was to use facebook's native form.  
  
We plugged it into a google sheets spreadsheet and the form answers  come automatically into the spreadsheet.  
  
But what changed it all was using the ""conditional logic"" feature.  
  
Basically, when you turn it on, you can choose one or more questions that will define an answer as ""qualified"" or not.  
  
So now facebook will only consider those types of answers as an actual ""lead"".  
  
**THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING**  
  
Last month we spent 4k in ads and generated 30k in revenue.  
  
This month we managed to reduce the cost per lead to 1/3rd, plus we doubled our daily ad spend so we're excited for that.  
  
That was only possible due to the increase in lead quality that allowed us to have 24k paid in fulls (2 year contract)   
  
Facebook's native lead form also allowed👉 us to have cheaper leads without losing quality of leads.   
👉I suspect this happened because when the traffic goes to your website facebook have a hard time to track it, but with the native lead form, this is no problem since the traffic is still in facebook.  
  
So recap:  
  
\- your ad creative should attack the inferior alternative to your Saas product  
\- use facebook's native form with the conditional logic turned ON  
\- get Rich

1hacs3q,Finding investors for consumer app,"
Hi,

I'm a technical founder (incorporated) for a new friend and date-finding app launching in Vancouver, Canada. Before you roll your eyes, I want to say that this is near and dear to my heart. So much so that I want to change the industry by offering the most important features for free and significantly undercut popular apps. There will be in-app purchases, yes. But I want to give the people the tools they need to find what they are looking for.

The MVP for iOS and Android is 70% done, and now I'm looking for potential investors to get this off the ground. The expensive part will be chat and database fees, as well as initial marketing in Vancouver (where it will be launched first), to make people aware of the app.

I'm new to all this, and I've learned a lot. But I have no clue how to find and approach people with money, that want to invest in a b2c app.

I would appreciate any tips, contacts, etc. Slide deck available.

A common reason was that some founders often found creative ways to avoid paying dividends. I came across this issue repeatedly through blogs and videos shared by people who experienced it firsthand.   
  
And even if the founders are trustworthy, a late-stage investor with a majority share could intentionally structure the company's finances to ensure profits are funneled toward their own interests, so that early contributors are left with nothing.

After doing some more research, however, I discovered this amazing thing called 'Gross Revenue Sharing'. Gross revenue sharing is a contractual agreement where payouts are based on the gross revenue—the total income a company earns before any expenses are deducted—rather than profits made. 

For example, an agreement might stipulate that if you work for the company for a specific period (say, five years) and meet a clear set of predetermined goals year after year, you will receive a fixed percentage of gross revenue (e.g., 0.001%) annually for the next 50 years(or whatever other number of years would be fair). This ensures a guaranteed reward that is not subject to potentially manipulated profit margins.

This way seems much safer and more secure than the usual equity or profit-sharing deals. And that's why I wanted to ask, with all these benefits, it makes me wonder why gross revenue sharing isn’t more common in the tech industry. Is it because people don’t know about it, doubt it would work, or is there another reason?",9,startups,1733669306.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kdd2/gross_revenue_sharing/

1h9vcrh,Investor Search and Responses,"I do SaaS fintech b2b. Very long sales cycles traditionally. I tried to raised $1M in a seed round back in Oct '23. First time Founder (but with 10years xp in my industry) and it was terrible. Wasted 6 months figuring out how to talk to these dummies.

At the time I had 3 clients which is big in my space, most startups fail to get the first client. I ended up only getting $400K, 1 check from a VC and 1 from an existing client. The VC is cool, but when they made intros to their friends it fell apart. The biggest feedback was that they didn't feel that the product was ""defence-able"".

On average, large competitors close 2-3 deals a month with a whole sales team and a marketing team. Solo, I did matched by myself. My product is just 10x better and I know how to sell. 

I now have 15 clients and those will be roughly ~ $1M arr once fully implemented. 3 of 12 major competitors are pulling out of the industry because they suck and the business is too tough for them. I need to take their market share in '25. 

My last VC is in for $500k again, term sheet in hand. 3 clients are pitching in $250k combined. The VC however wants me to raise atleast $1M this time however. (We agree on this number, but it's not necessary for me but they think it is). 

So. I hate talking to VC. I have very little tolerance for them taking time away from my family and my clients. How do I go back previous VC that passed and tell them to give me money in as few words as possible? 

Plan B, is to shoot a text out to all the other start-up CEOs I have made friends with over the last decade, and tell them know I need $250K to round out a $1M raise and see who's going to do me a solid a make an intro. 

If I go outside my existing network, do I have to actually make a pitch deck? Or can I get away without that, or half-ass it. Really don't want to spend the hours to make it perfect. I expect to grow to $5M ARR next year and grow faster than any other company in the space. But I won't do that if I waste my time begging folks for money over Zoom. 

Looking for advice or to vent. The VC world borderline doesn't make sense to me. Why make 100 phone calls to raise $250K and when I make 100 phone calls to earn $1M arr?

1h9kczb,Hesitate if I should release my app that has an major defect.,"Here is the background story. I made an app
that help people to learn music staff. The app will show a note on the screen and let users play it, then, it will listen to what users are playing and compute the frequency via a pitch detection algorithm. If the user does play the right note, he will gain a score. The problem is, the algorithm, provided by a small open source library, suffers from octave error. That is, it will give you doubled or half frequency of the pitch that the user's playing, and this situation happens quite often. This make the app produce falsy result. For example, the app shows a A4 note (the frequency is 440hz), and when a user plays a A3 note (the frequency is 220hz), there is a great chance the app thinks the user plays the right note, because the algorithm outputs a false doubled frequency of what the user's playing (A3). To fix this problem requires lots of efforts for me. Either I have to try different open source libraries and evaluate them, or even write my own algorithm. It is really time-consuming.

As what Learn Startup says, I should build a MVP ASAP and find out whether it is what my customers want, so I am considering to release my app now, even it is far from perfect. However I am also fear that releasing an app with such obvious defect will give them a really bad impression about the app. Since I am going to promote the app to music teachers near my place, and I think it is not easy to find one that is willing to try my app, if they dislike it because of the defect, they won't become my users and give me feedback, and I won't know if the app idea is viable. However if I choose to solve to octave error, I might end up wasting time, since I don't know if people need it. Now I really don't know what should I do.",1,startups,1733669273.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h9kczb/hesitate_if_i_should_release_my_app_that_has_an/
1h94egx,Incentives sound low to join as a founding engineer,"Assuming you get a 4 year vesting schedule and say the company it gets acquired in M&amp;A deal the year or two after you join. Then what's the buyers incentive for keeping the upside on employee equity vs just reducing it to market based compensation?

Example an employee takes a haircut in pay to join a startup, that does well and gets acquired. The employee may have turned their 400k grant to 2M with 2 years left to vest. The acquiring company can determine this is overpaying and reduce their compensation to market pay - let's say 250k stock per year instead of 500K. 

Wouldn't this be less incentive to join a startup vs the alternative of big tech (which will have “uncapped” upside on stock growth + annual refreshers).

1h9347e,I Scaled Two E-Commerce Brands to $1M in Annual Revenue Simultaneously within 2 Years — Here's My Story,"I wanted to share my journey of scaling *two* e-commerce brands to $1M in annual revenue at the same time within two years. It wasn’t easy, and I didn’t follow some “perfect formula.” My path was built on years of grit, instinct, and simply showing up. 

I’m not sharing this as an attempt to “gain karma” or whatever and I’m not sure if this will even be inspiring given the circumstances but entrepreneurship is like a form of science to me and I believe this data may provide some sort of value to the community.  

Here’s the unfiltered version of how it happened:  

---

### My Background  
I grew up working manual labor jobs. One of my earliest jobs was hauling 60lb buckets of liquid rubber for industrial roofing. Later, I became an electrician apprentice, earning a decent hourly wage but always living paycheck to paycheck.  

On the side, I pursued a music career for 18 years. I ran my own record label, spent $5,000-$6,000 per album, and even landed an independent record deal at 19. I thought I’d “made it.” Spoiler: I hadn’t.  

The deal fell apart, and I ended up back where I started—broke and barely getting by.  

---

### The Options Trading Era  
About a year before I started in e-commerce, I got into options trading. My first trade was a small-cap stock I heard about on YouTube. I was convinced this stock was going to blow up, so I put $4,000 into call options the night before a big announcement.  

The next morning, I woke up to my portfolio up **$12,000 in the first hour.**  

This was the most money I’d ever had, and I made it just by pressing buttons from the comfort of my home. It broke my frame of what I thought was possible.  

---

I kept trading. In 2020, during lockdowns and the height of the meme stock era, I turned my portfolio from $15,000 to **$88,000** in a month. “This is it,” I thought. This is how I achieve financial freedom.  

But it didn’t last. Over the next 11 months, my portfolio slowly shrank from $88,000 to **$12,000.** At one point, I made $40,000 in a single day. I was convinced it was the next GameStop and held onto my position instead of selling. The next day, all those gains disappeared.  

---

### A Phone Call That Changed Everything  
After an agonizing year of going back to work while watching my investments dwindle, I received a phone call from a friend who had moved to Arizona. He told me he’d quit his job and was working for himself now.  

He started out renting cars on Turo and turned it into a full-fledged business. We had shared a desire for more since our music days together, and I was so happy to see him succeed. But it made me realize: I was wasting my time chasing the pipe dream of stock trading.  

This whole time, I could have started working on a real business and been my own boss by now.  

---

### The Shift to E-Commerce  
That same night, I decided I had to do something.  

I had been dabbling in “Print on Demand” platforms like Printful and Printify, creating designs for t-shirts, mugs, and bags to sell on Etsy and Amazon. My plan was simple: learn how to do that better.  

I went on YouTube and found a 5-hour tutorial on Amazon FBA. I didn’t know what FBA was, but I thought it might have some tips for improving my print-on-demand hustle.  

The video wasn’t about print on demand—it was about private labeling. The method was simple:  

1️⃣ Choose a product with manageable competition.  
2️⃣ Make it higher quality.  
3️⃣ Make it stand out.  

The video explained the three pillars of a successful product: **quality, branding, and marketing.**  

I stayed up until 2 a.m. taking six pages of notes. The next morning, I told my wife about it. Normally, she’s the skeptical type, but she was on board—which made me believe I was on to something.  

---

### Becoming Obsessed  
Shortly after, I became obsessed.  

During my 2-hour daily commute, I listened to every audiobook and YouTube tutorial on e-commerce and Amazon I could find. I even played videos in the background while at work. I went down a rabbit hole, soaking up as much information as possible to prepare for the business I now believed I was *made for.*  

---

### Building Two Brands  
I launched two brands, each focused on different markets.  My degenerate way of thinking was that by starting two at the same time it would double my chance of success. 

I believe hitting the $1m in annual revenue milestone came down to this:  

1️⃣ **High-Quality Products**: No cutting corners. If it’s not great, it won’t last.  
2️⃣ **Creative Branding**: I treated branding like an art form, creating emotional experiences for customers.  
3️⃣ **Packaging That Pops**: For one product, I designed packaging so unique that our unboxing video generated $500k in sales alone.  

---

### The Role of Instinct  
Most of my journey has been instinctual. I didn’t have a team or mentors in the beginning. I relied on gut decisions shaped by my years in music, manual labor, and even trading.  

Music taught me how to tell stories and focus on details most people overlook. Manual labor taught me resilience and that entrepreneurship, while stressful, is *not* hard work compared to carrying buckets of rubber in 88-degree heat.  Trading, taught me how much money is out there. 

---

### The Biggest Lesson I Learned  
Here’s the truth:  
You can win, even if you suck.  

Why? Because most people fail to do one simple thing: **show up.**  

---

### My Advice to You  
If you’re stuck in a tough spot, remember this:  

“The difference between where you are and where you want to be is knowledge. And it’s literally in your hands (Your Phone). You have no excuse, therefore it’s a choice.”  

No one will care if you succeed or not. It’s up to you to decide what kind of life you want.

1h9j8ie,Insect feed startup in latam (I need a plan),"I have a small business in a Latin American country that produces red runner roaches, mealworms, Zophobas, some black soldier fly larvae, and crickets. All are currently at small-scale levels but with the capacity for growth. I’m a science student and know how to produce them, but I lack expertise in business.

I have some leadership experience from directing a grassroots movement and have many friends and connections, mostly in Latin America and Europe. I currently live in Lisbon and know some people working in venture capital who could help with funding. I also know scientists and professionals from various developing nations from my time at a major international science center, as well as some local politicians and a friend with a farm in Italy.

I feel like I have the conditions to succeed and grow a successful business. However, what’s limiting us is that both my business partner and I are more focused on biology and science. My partner has a BSc in biology, works in wildlife conservation (birds), and raises cattle. I’m a physicist studying evolution and biology, specifically yeastcell biology. Despite our skills, we struggle to concentrate on growing the business.

Right now, we’re making around $65 in small monthly sales, while I pay $130 and my associate $200 out of pocket to cover food for the insects and electricity. Some tasks, like producing more insects, are easier than building something like an oven to dry them.

Our goals include:

• Increasing sales

• Producing our own chicken feed

• Selling compost as a by-product

• Entering the biotech market with products like chitosan

Currently, we have one part-time employee and occasionally hire a second person on a day-to-day basis. I want to hire a friend with extensive entomology experience who worked at a mealworm startup (to which I sold the original colony for $3k), but I can’t afford to hire him full-time. I’m considering paying him a daily rate and having him work a few times a month.

I’d like to buy a solar dryer to start prototyping chicken feed with the BSF but feel unsure about how to move forward. I also own two generic domain names but think we need a better business name. I believe we should create a LinkedIn page, ask friends to share on social media, and build our presence online.

What would you do if you were in my position?

We are a team of account executives with years of sales experience, most of us were previously in tech sales. We have clients who have hired us as their outsourced sales team so there is revenue already coming into the business. Right now we use third-party VoIP calling services, email services, and CRMs (i.e. Salesforce) on a subscription basis paid for by the clients so they can have access to the entire sales process for transparency. It gets pricey for them and we'd like to instead develop our own proprietary software platform that integrates VoIP, CRM, and sales tools. We obviously cannot create a VoIP service from scratch but we can for everything else, so we'll just be integrating the VoIP through API from our preferred provider.

I've been interviewing for a Technical Product Manager position that will eventually develop to the Chief Technology Officer as the company grows.

1h9s097,Repost with more info: How do I show tens of ideas for cofounders to choose without getting my ideas stolen?,"Ok, let me repost this because I didn't explain and obviously it went out of control: people went with the usual ""Nobody will steal your ideas"" or the ""idea is nothing without execution”.

Please read, and I hope you can help me.

Hi guys, I have lots of startup ideas and I was wondering which was the best way to share these ideas with possible technical cofounders for them to choose without getting my ideas exposed.

The goal would be to create a startup lab where students and new devs can pick and choose what they want to develop (based on their skills and experience) to learn how to be a startupper and be guided by this lab.

I already received green light from the townhall and our university that will allocate resources to fund this lab and the ideas that will be born from it.

Trust me, if I just wanted to make money it would be much easier to just gather investors and launch the ideas in the list starting from the best to the worst but I'm not doing this for money, at least not only for that.
I genuinely want to do good, I want to create something that will help people create new things and new companies in this new environment where they’re guided, without the risk of more experienced startuppers or software houses stealing the “formative” work.

I could talk literally for hours about this thing but please trust me that I'm not a random guy that just wants to protect his ideas while he talks to devs.

So going back to the “problem”:

Obviously I can't make them sign NDAs for tens, maybe even a hundred, of ideas, and I can't even make them sign a single NDA for all of them because then the contract won't be specific enough.

1h8g50t,I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer,"Had a beer with a buddy of mine the other day—he’s a CRO at a 130-person tech startup. Out of nowhere, he’s like, “Man, I hate being a Chief Revenue Officer.” Not gonna lie, I laughed at first, but then I realized he was dead serious.

So I ask him what’s up, and he just starts venting. He said the hardest part is he feels like he’s supposed to know everything that’s happening in the company, but it’s impossible. Marketing’s doing one thing, sales is doing another, and customer success is in their own little world. And somehow, he’s supposed to connect all the dots and make the revenue grow?

Then he talks about how he has all these big plans—like where they need to be in 6 months, how they should be scaling, all that good stuff. But when it comes to actually putting those plans into action, it’s a mess. Teams don’t align, priorities clash, and stuff just doesn’t get done. He said it feels like no matter how much effort he puts in, something’s always slipping through the cracks.

His exact words: “It’s like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it’s lost deals and missed opportunities. And I’m the only one holding the hammer.”

Honestly, it sounded rough, and it got me wondering—do other CROs feel this way too?

If you’re a CRO (or close to one), what’s the hardest part of your job? Is it the lack of visibility, the struggle to get stuff done, or something else?

Sending emails is inexpensive compared to other marketing or sales methods like paid ads. My tools of choice, Coldsire + Instantly, has allowed me to outreach to a large audience without significant additional costs.

**Precision + Measurable**

My emails are tailored to specific industries, companies, or individuals with precision.

The other aspect I like? Measurable results. I can track open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure the effectiveness of campaigns.

This has helped me with insights from email performance data to refine future outreach efforts.

And I’ve learnt a ton so far that’s helping me improve.

If I had to distill those learnings, it would be this:

1) Personalize: Reference specific details about the recipient or their company.  
2) Provide Value: Offer a clear benefit or solution to a problem the recipient may face.  
3) Be Concise: Keep your message brief and to the point.  
4) Include a Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state what you want the recipient to do next (e.g., schedule a call, visit your website).  
5) Follow Up: Don’t rely on a single email; send polite follow-ups to increase response rates.

**Tools I use**

When used ethically and strategically, cold emails can be a highly effective way to generate leads, grow your business, or create meaningful connections.

Useful tools I use to do cold email:

Google Workspace  
Apollo  
Coldsire  
Clay  
Instantly

If you’re not cold email outreach with AI, try it! You’d be surprised. Happy to answer more specific questions.",21,startups,1733567604.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h8pt5k/cold_email_works_heres_my_experiencerecommended/
1h8tnov,Seeking advice on having transparent discussions about early-stage startup ideas,"(Sorry about the robotic sounding text - I basically word vomited into Claude and had to clean up my thoughts for me. Appreciate any help!)

  
I'm an aspiring entrepreneur discussing some AI product ideas with potential customers and engineers to get feedback. My goal is to have open and collaborative conversations but also ensure everyone is on the same page regarding roles and expectations.

I want to avoid situations where someone thinks they deserve equity or ownership just for providing input. However, I also really value these relationships and don't want them to sour due to misunderstandings. Protecting the work is important but maintaining trust and goodwill is equally critical.

I'm looking for advice from other founders on how to strike the right balance:

* What's the best way to communicate upfront to avoid incorrect expectations?
* At what point does it make sense to introduce legal agreements?
* Any specific language to use (or avoid) to keep things clear but still friendly and collaborative?
* Cautionary tales or lessons learned about damaging relationships by not setting expectations early?

My aim is to build strong, productive connections while being transparent. I don't want to be overly guarded but also want to mitigate the risk of misunderstandings that could undermine trust. 

Appreciate any wisdom from those who have navigated this before!",5,startups,1733581855.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h8tnov/seeking_advice_on_having_transparent_discussions/

I’m pricing the online community in two membership tiers. One oriented towards aspiring students thinking about entering a specific field, and existing students across 15 or so US universities at a price point to $49.95 a month. The next tier is professional level, existing community members in early to mid career, looking to connect with professionals in the industry at a price point of $99 a month.

Those who are in this industry are fairly affluent. It is hard to enter the industry, and 99% of those who do go through a masters program. 

Building critical mass early is important. I’ve thought about, but I’ve decided not to offer a free tier. My concern being that the community is flooded with wannabes and ultimately would devalue the community. 

I’m trying to solve for Network effect. I currently do not have any members.

I thought about offering coupon codes to industry insiders they could pass out to others to join that would provide for a period of free access to the site so long as they use a credit card to sign up. I thought about swag after the second month of payment. I’m going to be using an affiliate program , so any new users can refer others for a percentage of the revenue. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for solving Network effect for niche communities? Any reading or other ideas people have seen?

1h8r9fp,Working on building a start-up with a friend of mine - couple questions about splits etc. ,"A little bit of background, both of us are post-grad students and our start-up is in the same industry as our research. 

  
We have been good friends for a while and always talked here and there about starting a company. I kind of stopped the ""talking"" and got to work and a week or two later told my friend that hey this is what I have been working on and we agreed to do it together.  I am CEO and he joined as CTO. 

He suggested we hire one of his friends to help us with the business development side of things and so far that person has been great. I hired them as Head of Business Development and I am happy with the work they have been doing (note this is judging on 2 weeks worth of work).

  
We are having our company planning meeting where we will discuss our split, company structure, vision, conflict resolution, expectations, roles, etc. 

  
The Business person hinted at wanting to be CFO, now I don't mind giving them that but I would rather do so a little bit later once I am more convinced of their work. However, how would the compensation model look for the CFO, obviously they will not have a major percentage like the co-founders, any pointers on what would be a good way to compensate them? 

  
Note this is just to put it in our agreements because at the moment no one is being compensated but it would be good to have an idea from now what the model will look like in the future. 

  
Hope that is a clear enough question I tried to explain as best as I could! 

  
TLDR: 2 week hire wants to be CFO (they are good at what they do so far) what is the best way to judge if they are suitable and what would be a good compensation model for them given they are not a cofounder?

This results in startups spending way too much time on flashy competitions and endless programs, and way less time actually running their businesses. There is only so many competitions you can go to before you actually need to start selling to customers.

• Opportunity to pool their talent on a bigger project and work with people with different skills and experience.

• Build skills working on real world project and also earn money doing so.

• Even as a beginner, start with free projects to earn points and earn enough points to apply for paid projects.

1h91q7g,I’m building an open source AI marketing bot that you can run for FREE (using Ollama),"We all know how valuable Reddit is for shilling your product (just look at this sub). A lot of founders are using it to promote their products.

One of the best ways to do it is to find out on which subs your customers are hanging out, following the threads there and comment with a helful idea while also mentioning your product.

I’ve been doing this manually for many months and it works great, but it’s so hard to scale. I also ended up spending waaaay to much time on reddit instead of watching a movie or going out :)).

I’ve seen tools that automate this using ChatGPT. I’ve even tried ReplyGuy myself, but the pricing is way too steep for an indie founder. Also very limited, something like 50 replies per month, which is super low IMO. I manage to do more than that manually.

Also, tools like ReplyGuy have a very nasty shortcoming, they search posts by keywords and reply to all of them. But most posts don’t deserve a comment since they have nothing to do with my product. The ideal way to do this would be to ask ChatGPT if the OP fits my customer profile and only then generate a comment.

Being a dev myself, I naturally thought I could build this and use it internally. At least be able to control the number of comments that it generates.

I finally have a working MVP that I plugged in a few days ago and is doing automated marketing for one of my sideprojects.

I also made it run on top of LLama 3.2 running locally on my laptop so there is NO ChatGPT cost. I’m basically running it for free.

Would be curious about if anyone would like to give it a try. I’m building it as an open source tool, but I don’t have any docs yet. So leave a comment for me to know there would be interest and I’ll write docs so you can run it yourself.

1h892yq,"I launched my MVP, started with the sales. This is what I found out:","Spoiler: I am not able to make a sale, and I don't see it as a bad thing.

Reasons: I am building in a market that is kind of underlooked till now. My first approach was building B2C, which was reasonable since the competitors in this space are also more user-focused. Until, I thought building a small user dashboard for B2B would add some extra points. So got to work: Built the backend and server using Django, Flutter for mobile apps, and Svelte for web. After a few iterations using the user (B2C feedback), I iterated the product around 12 times. 

The turning point was realising that in order to sell the product, I have to approach the businesses through which their users can access and buy from these businesses (marketplace kind of). Till I realised much more about the competition and my product. 

I could not make sales because there is a certain improvement that is required in my product (this is the feedback from more than 80% of the businesses). But there was one thing that they liked about my product: the B2B dashboard, which wasn't provided by any other of my VC-funded competitors. One of the best feedbacks I got from them was a need for a few more CRM/ERP features that could enhance their operations. 

What I found the best is that to solve this market, a B2B SaaS panel is a higher priority product than the B2C marketplace app that I built for the businesses' users. The funny thing is that the competitors that exist since mid-2010s never did anything for the B2B side.

Negative feedback isn't a bad thing, IMO; if a startup's main focus is PMF, then this is the only way. Focused on doing sales, but looking for more feedback teaches a lot. If there's anything anyone wants to give me as advice or suggestion on, feel free to.

My costs are escalating for Bubble and my WUs have passed 1.5 million, and now I am close to getting billed in 1k on monthly basis. On top of that, I want to do something with the app which I can't do technically. 

I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to move towards development.

So I found this guy from a referral and talked to him over call for 3 times, he's super interesting, mainly works on developing MVP, quite easy to talk with and has an eye for details. I was expecting him to give me a quotation but he asked me if I could give him equity of 10% and fund him a little(8k USD).

For me personally, I have no issues since my burn rate will be more with Bubble and a lot more work for myself alone. Also given the experience and impressive projects which he has built with his team, I'm getting more inclined towards this deal.

I also received quotations from 5 agencies more and it was around 35-65k USD and on top of that a maintenance and support contract.

I have a startup that does package forwarding, and we are developing a plug-in for Shopify and other e-commerce platforms where we allow merchants in the US to start shipping internationally in 15 minutes without changing their usual workflow

This is how it works: you add our checkout plug-in to your website, your customers input their international address, and you ship their orders to our US warehouse using your usual process with domestic customers—no changes needed

From there, we take care of customs, shipping labels, and shipping to their address anywhere in the world

1h7x1in,What are some things you only learn AFTER becoming a boss?,"Starting a business is one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences. But the reality of being a boss is often very different from what we expect. There are certain things that only hit you once you're in charge, and these lessons are often learned the hard way.I’d love to hear from other entrepreneurs and startup founders: what are some things that surprised you about being a boss? Things you never expected, but learned quickly once you took the reins?Here are a few of my own observations:

1. **Everything depends on you**: The weight of responsibility is real. You're not just thinking about your own work, but about your team, your clients, your finances, your marketing strategy... everything.
2. **Time management is EVERYTHING**: As a boss, you're pulled in so many directions. Prioritizing and managing your time becomes a skill you never knew you'd have to develop.
3. **Your team’s mood affects the business**: It's not just about your ideas and your drive; your team’s energy and motivation directly impact the overall success of the business. For example, I once hired a highly-skilled engineer at a high salary. He was great technically, but his communication style was aggressive, and he would often show up late to meetings and interrupt others during discussions. His emotional instability made the team too afraid to approach him, which significantly hindered the project’s progress. As his leader, I addressed the issue multiple times and sought solutions, but there was little change. Ultimately, I decided to end the working relationship to maintain a healthy team environment.
4. **You can’t do it all yourself**: Every person has their strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important to recognize that. Admitting that you can’t do everything isn't a sign of weakness. In fact, it’s more efficient to delegate specialized tasks to those who are experts in those areas. Trusting your team to handle what they do best is not only empowering for them but will also make your business more effective overall. Trying to do everything yourself will lead to burnout, and your business will suffer as a result.

I’m building a startup in the healthcare space focused on doctors, hospitals, and clinical trials. I’ve done a bottom-up market size approximation across these sectors and have a decent understanding of my Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).

I wanted to get your thoughts on a couple of key questions:
	1.	What is an attractive SOM for VCs in the healthcare space?
For example, is there a general SOM threshold (e.g., $100M, $200M, etc.) that investors find appealing?
	2.	What percentage of SOM should I ideally target to achieve within 5 years for it to be considered a strong and viable investment?
I’m trying to ensure my 5-year projections align with what VCs typically expect.

1h88f75,"How does vesting work for funded, single-founder companies?","What's the standard for vesting for single-founder startups?

For startups with more than one founder, I think it's reasonable to demand that both founders vest.

However, if you have a single founder, I wan't necessary planning to setup a vesting schedule for myself.

I think though, that if I take external investment, under *normal* terms that the VCs might insist.

I'm not sure what the normal situation is here though.

Do the investors force the single-founder to vest?

Now, I'm hoping to have really solid financials so I can at least have *some* leverage here.

Honestly, I'm sure some founders can get away with it if they have insane numbers.  

If you're 2 months old and making like $5M per year and 10000% month over month growth you can basically demand anything and the VCs will be down.

I’ve been dreaming of starting a startup for a while now. I even have some good ideas. But every time I think about starting, I feel stuck. It’s not like I don’t want to do it – I do! But some common problems keep holding me back.

* **No domain knowledge:** I know tech stuff, but when it comes to business things like marketing, finance, or even running a company, I’m clueless.

1h8glkz,I'm beyond fucked right now,"Hi, I'm 18M. A non technical founder. Since the past 4 months I've working on an online shopping app for my country, as there is a huge gap in the apps space here. I know zero coding and had hired a developer for cheap to develop the app for me, now the app is almost complete but i'm unsure about what i'll do for the maintenance of the app since the guy I was working with says that he'll be too busy to give it any tike. 

I'm not sure if I can afford huge maintenance cost for the app and neither can I fix even the smallest bugs on my own. and even if I hire another developer for maintenance, i'm still not sure if that's risk free or not as he might steal the source code (heck I don't even know what i'm supposed to do with a source code) 

I can either find someone to do maintenance for the app so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what's the procedure for that, what to keep in mind when hiring or giving access to the app, guidelines etc as I have zero tech knowledge. 

Also, if I hire a developer for maintenance, are there any chances he can like steal the app from me? like remove my access or anything (I'm already sorry if any of this sounds super silly) 

Another option I have is learn the basics myself and try to fix minor bugs myself if I come across any. Could you tell me how long would it take not to learn complete IOS or android development, but just simple maintenance or fixing bugs?

1h7naik,$5k processing fee from company for selling $50k exercised startup shares...is this normal?,"When I worked for a startup for a while a few years ago, I got some options and   exercised many of them before I moved to another company. I've held onto the shares since, and the company has done well and raised successive large rounds. The company is not doing a tender offer anytime soon however, and seems unlikely to go public anytime soon, so I've tried to find a private market buyer via a broker as I think the startup has peaked in value. 

I was lucky to find one and got through the process all the way to a share transfer agreement, however the final transaction transfer document specifies a $5,000 fee I'm supposed to pay the company to ""cover legal costs"" for the share transfer. 

I'm already paying about 10% to the broker, and I really didn't expect to pay an additional 10% to the company for this. I talked with a lawyer friend who said that charging fees is pretty normal, but usually for basic work like this it's a much smaller fee. So I'm surprised and a little upset to discover this so late in the process, and especially coming from the very company that I worked for! It feels a little like a tactic to minimize share transfers by former employees - they're taking it just because they have gatekeeping access. 

I had a great experience with the company and I'm super friendly with the people there still - how would you handle this? Is this something you've seen before? Should I just pay it and get it over with?

1h7k5e0,What I Wish I Did Sooner as a New Founder (Advice for You!),"**If I could go back in time to day one of my founder journey, here’s the one thing I’d do differently…**

**Document your journey.**

It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, a simple selfie while you’re working, a quick note about what you accomplished today, or even a snapshot of your workspace.

**Here’s why it matters:**

* **It motivates you.** When you’re deep in the grind, it’s easy to forget how far you’ve come. Documenting your progress gives you a way to look back and see the incredible growth you’ve achieved.
* **It builds your presence.** Whether for investors, partners, or potential customers, your journey is part of your story. Sharing it consistently helps people connect with you and your vision.

**My biggest regret:**  
I’ve worked for almost 3 years full-time on my business without documenting much. I only have a handful of photos and videos from those early days. Looking back, I see how much progress I’ve made, but I wish I had captured more.

Now, I’m bootstrapping a product and brand I believe can redefine the tech and gaming hardware market (my first product is a PC case) with innovative designs and features, but no one knows I exist. Building a social media presence takes time, and I’ve learned the hard way how important it is to start early. It’s one of the biggest things slowing down my startup right now.

**If you’re just starting out:**

* Be proud of what you’re doing.
* Share your wins and your challenges.
* If you’re not ready to post publicly, save those moments for yourself.

I used to hate the idea of being visible online, but I’ve realized that sharing your story can inspire others and help you in ways you might not expect.

**Don’t wait. Start documenting today, even if it’s just for yourself, you’ll thank yourself later.**",23,startups,1733433519.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7k5e0/what_i_wish_i_did_sooner_as_a_new_founder_advice/

1h81uv4,Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (summary),"This is a summary by ChatGPT of FirstRound's terrific ""How to Build a Billion-Dollar Marketplace — Do’s and Don’ts from the Growth Expert Behind Grubhub, Pinterest, and More"" article (link to the original in the comments):

# Key Lessons for Building a Billion-Dollar Marketplace (Detailed Version)

# Choosing the Right Idea

* **Do**: Pick a market with a wide variety of suppliers and fragmented competition.
   * Example: Grubhub succeeded because it offered diverse restaurant options, increasing its value to customers and suppliers alike.
   * High supplier variety allows marketplaces to scale and generate revenue through transaction fees.
* **Don’t**: Target markets with low transaction frequency or high customer loyalty to single suppliers.
   * Example: A marketplace for haircuts struggles because customers are loyal to one barber and purchase infrequently.

# Acquiring Early Customers

* **Do**:
   * Develop a **scalable acquisition loop**:
      * Use supplier-generated content, such as menus or detailed service data, to drive SEO-based demand.
      * Example: Grubhub indexed restaurant menu data, making it easier for users to find their platform via search engines.
   * Embrace **non-scalable early actions** to validate demand and supply:
      * Example: DoorDash’s founder delivered meals himself in the early days to test the market.
   * Start with a **low-risk supplier acquisition model**:
      * Example: Grubhub only charged restaurants if they received orders, lowering the barrier to joining.
* **Don’t**:
   * Invest too heavily in polished software early:
      * Example: Grubhub’s early platform relied on fax machines for orders. The priority was acquiring supply, not building perfect technology.
   * Rely on suppliers to drive demand to your marketplace:
      * A marketplace thrives when it actively generates demand for its suppliers, rather than passively depending on them to bring in customers.

# Retaining Customers

* **Do**:
   * Understand the **three stages of customer acquisition**:
      1. **Setup**: Ensure users easily input the necessary data to use the service (e.g., Grubhub asking for a delivery address).
      2. **“Aha” Moment**: Provide immediate value that surprises and delights the user (e.g., showcasing a broader selection of restaurants than expected).
      3. **Habit Formation**: Reinforce usage through repeated positive experiences (e.g., users turning to Grubhub weekly for diverse meal options).
   * Use **targeted discounts** strategically:
      * Example: Grubhub offered discounts for mobile app downloads to increase retention among higher-LTV customers.
* **Don’t**:
   * Overuse discounts, which can shift your value proposition to cost-saving rather than quality or selection.
   * Ignore supply-side quality:
      * Example: Grubhub removed poorly rated restaurants from the platform to maintain a high customer experience standard.

# Expanding the Customer Base

* **Do**:
   * **Raise supply standards over time**:
      * Incentivize positive supplier behaviors (e.g., Airbnb’s Instant Book to make hosts more appealing to travelers).
      * Remove low-quality suppliers to protect the marketplace’s reputation.
   * **Adapt your value proposition**:
      * Example: Uber initially focused on luxury black cars to establish trust but shifted to affordability to scale.
   * **Grow with your customers**:
      * Improve supply variety and availability as customer expectations grow.
      * Example: Grubhub scaled from 10 to 1,000+ restaurant options in cities to retain less frequent users.
* **Don’t**:
   * Rush into new categories or markets without refining your playbook:
      * Example: DoorDash spent a decade perfecting food delivery before expanding into new markets like grocery delivery.

# Scaling Up

* **Do**:
   * Invest in **data sophistication**:
      * Move beyond aggregate metrics to segmented analysis (e.g., different user behavior for frequent vs. infrequent suppliers).
      * Example: Eventbrite segmented users by event type (e.g., monthly vs. annual) to understand retention better.
   * Address **supplier churn** by identifying and solving for their activation metrics:
      * Example: Grubhub found that suppliers with at least two daily orders were more likely to stay on the platform.
   * Be a **fast follower**:
      * Rapidly adapt to competitors’ successful innovations.
      * Example: Rover added dog walking after Wag introduced it, capitalizing on higher-frequency demand.
* **Don’t**:
   * Ignore supply churn, as inactive suppliers undermine your marketplace’s liquidity.
   * Sacrifice long-term investments for short-term growth (e.g., prioritizing U.S. growth at Pinterest delayed international expansion).

# General Strategies for Marketplaces

* **Liquidity is Key**:
   * Secure both supply and demand early to achieve a balanced, functional marketplace.
* **Trust is Foundational**:
   * Build credibility through user reviews, supplier standards, and clear value propositions.
* **Iterate Based on Data**:
   * Use dashboards and customer insights to refine acquisition, retention, and expansion strategies.

# Case Studies and Insights

1. **Grubhub**:
   * Scaled rapidly by leveraging supplier data for SEO and improving supplier quality to meet growing demand.
2. **Faire**:
   * Onboarded suppliers for free and cross-sold them to boutiques, reducing acquisition costs.
3. **Eventbrite**:
   * Created consumer-facing tools to generate demand while retaining its SaaS platform for event organizers.
4. **Whatnot**:
   * Started with a niche (Funko Pops) but carefully expanded to other categories after proving its core model.

# Key Foundational Mindsets

* **Adaptability**: Innovate and evolve based on market trends and competitive pressures.
* **Patience**: Invest in foundational growth strategies that will pay off in the long run.
* **Focus**: Prioritize refining your core market before expanding into new verticals or geographies.
* **Customer-Centric Approach**: Consistently improve the customer and supplier experience to enhance retention and loyalty.

1h87kt3,Carpooling could disrupt the cab industry.,"Carpooling has the potential to eat into the regularized cab industry, but it’s not yet structured or well-backed by tech.

We humans love connecting with qualified strangers, and carpooling can make that possible. Imagine an executive traveling 15 km to their company. Instead of a ride with an unknown driver, they can carpool with a consultant who’s been in the industry for 20-25 years. 

The value of such an exchange is immeasurable—valuable knowledge shared, strong networks built, and a higher level of security compared to rides with drivers from lower strata or remote areas.

To make this a reality, several things need to be fixed:

1.Quick Availability of Drivers: We need a large number of drivers ready to offer rides, ensuring easy availability.

2.Modernized Mobile App: A highly efficient app is key to seamlessly matching users and drivers.

3.Security: Carpooling with qualified professionals provides higher security compared to unknown drivers.

1h6nfv4,How I Used AI to Raise $1.3M With No Product or Revenue,"I’m a first-time founder. Six months ago, We had no revenue, no customers—just a hacked-together demo. My co-founder and I had solid experience working together at a successful unicorn, but we’d never pitched VCs before and had no idea how to raise money.

A key part of raising money is your pitch deck. I used a few simple ChatGPT prompts to create and refine ours, which helped us raise a $1.3M pre-seed round.

Here’s what worked for me:


**Build a Foundation**

I started by reading every pre-seed pitch deck I could find. Two resources stood out:

* TechCrunch Pitch Deck Teardown
* ChiefAI Office

To understand structure, I relied on Guy Kawasaki’s 10-slide framework. This gave me a clear idea of what investors expect and how to frame our story.


**Iteration With AI**


Once I had a basic structure, I used ChatGPT to iterate. My process looked like this:

* Create a draft.
* Feed it into GPT with this prompt:
	Attached is a startup pitch deck. Pretend you’re a seasoned VC investor who is assessing this company at the preseed stage. Please review the slides, create a rubric, and offer feedback about this pitch deck. Think step by step and be brutally honest.

Why this prompt worked:

* Roleplay: It frames GPT as a seasoned VC.
* Rubric: Creates consistency for feedback (you can even supply the rubric in future sessions).
* Think step by step: Encourages detailed, logical feedback.
* Be brutally honest: Chat tuned LLMs have a tendency to be overly people pleasing. This helps temper that.

The feedback looked like this:

* Problem Statement:
Score: 3.5/5. The problem identifies real pain points, but it’s vague and lacks supporting data. Investors need to see specific metrics or case studies that quantify the pain and prove it’s a significant issue worth solving.

I’d follow up with questions like:

* Can you help me find supporting data for the problem statement?

Then I’d revise and repeat.

I went through ~30 revisions before showing the deck to my co-founder. We refined it further, making it more polished with every pass.

**Founder Feedback**

When the deck felt ready, I reached out to founders in my city who had recently raised money. These were cold emails—no friends, no warm intros. I asked for 30 minutes of their time to review our pitch in person.

This was by far the best decision we made. Founders were incredibly generous with their time and gave actionable feedback:

* “This investor will drill into your TAM—make sure it’s airtight.”
* “Avoid using the term ‘AI agent’ with these firms.”

Their input helped us avoid rookie mistakes, refine our messaging, and even introduced us to investors and early users.

**The Result**

We landed a lead investor and a term sheet in our first meeting. Filling out the rest of the round took more time and effort - about 3 months overall. If there’s one thing I wish someone had told me: Don’t raise money in the summer.

1h7aic5,My friend's dad passed away and i am trying to help him.,"Hey Reddit, I’m here hoping to get some guidance from this amazing community.

A close friend of mine recently lost his father, and it’s been devastating for their family. His dad was involved in the alco-bev industry for over 20 years, co-running a company with a few partners. He wasn’t the technical guy, and played a key role in sales and relationships.

After his passing, the other founders have been trying to push my friend out of the company. It’s heartbreaking to see him struggle like this, especially since he now has the huge responsibility of providing for his family.

He’s trying to start his own business in the same field, focusing on importing Vatted Malt Spirit (VMS) from Scotland to India. The thing is, he doesn't know much about how this supply chain works or how to even get started. But he wants to continue in this field since his father accumulated a lot of good will in this industry and he kinda wants to continue his father's legacy.

If anyone has experience in the alco-bev industry, especially with Scottish distilleries or international supply chains, I would really appreciate your advice. My friend has lost so much already, and I just want to do everything I can to help him rebuild.

Thanks in advance for any insights or connections you can share. It would mean the world to both of us. 🙏",5,startups,1733409220.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h7aic5/my_friends_dad_passed_away_and_i_am_trying_to/

1h7eo7c,PLEASE consider also other pricing options than Subscriptions,"A full time business/start up coach here! I'm like a therapist, people come to me when they have a problem or a challenge, we meet once a week/month and I help them overcome whatever it is they need to deal with. I meet some of the most intelligent, creative and innovative people I could imagine exist. But with every business there's the same pricing: Subscriptions. 

  
Sibscriptions do obviously make sense for some businesses. But I keep running into businesses where they don't make sense at all, sometimes I wonder if people even consider other options. 

I understand that sub pricing is very attractive for businesses but please understand that once you choose a subscription model, you suddenly compete with all other subscriptions people have. People can only afford so many subscriptions a month, not many people have so much loose income that they can just subscribe 20 different services. And once you choose sub pricing, people will create a list in their mind of all the monthly subscriptions they have and choose the ones they want/need the most. And now you are competing suddenly also with Netflix, YouTube Premium etc. No one ever seems to think about this although it's incredibly important. 

The title is not meant to express any annoyance but meant to be funny. Funny because it's true :) 

What do you think? 

And again, have nothing against subscriptions. I just run into the craziest case today where this made absolutely 0 sense and put a note to my mind to post about it later on.

1h6pm9q,"10 startup over 10 years, what went right and what went wrong with each","I had my first idea for a startup in 2013, having already had a more traditional business for years (a screen printing business) and tried my hand at drop shipping multiple times (terrible results).

It’s been a battle. Satisfying but no huge successes so far, but my current startup feels promising, so I keep going!

Here’s what each startup did, what was good about each, and what ultimately killed it or just held it back:

**1- Online dating profile reviews**

Description/background: My first startup! I had done online dating a lot myself, and saw a startup that used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to crowdsource website feedback, and I became fascinated by that idea, and wanted to build something with it too.

Good: I could help people improve their profiles. I had some guys use it and tell me it helped. And I ran my own OkCupid profile through it before meeting my now wife (together ten years now, 2 kids, happy, hooray!) And everyone thought it was a neat idea. I was even able to get press about it. 

Bad: You’re critiquing humans, basically, so that’s tough. Also it required scraping online dating profiles to get the info to show to the reviewers, which was hard to keep working technically, as scrapers would break if sites changed layout. No organic word of mouth with users because who would tell their friends “I needed online dating help so I paid for it”? No customer retention because they’d get one or maybe two rounds of feedback and that was it. I racked up like $30k in credit card debt with developers, whoopsie. It never did more than $400 a month in revenue.

It died because: I just got so burned out on it. We ran into a technical issue one day and I just told my dev I was done with it all. Too difficult. I wrote an emotional piece on killing my startup, posted that, and pulled the plug on the site.

Lesson learned: Pick a model that encourages word of mouth and return customers. And look for dead competitors when validating a startup idea!

**2- Startup feedback with an investment twist**

Description/background: A startup founder who pay $500 to get feedback from a panel of 9 experts on their site’s marketing, conversion rate optimization, or their pitch deck. We’d review one per day, and put that money into a fund that would then be invested into the highest-reviewed startup each month.

Good: Easy to get attention and experts on board because it was a neat idea, and people wanted to help out. 

Bad: It was SO complicated to try to figure out how to make that financing work. Also we’d have to pay taxes on the $500 payments because it’s income, so that reduced how much we could actually invest. And we couldn’t make any money as the founders because it was supposed to all be going into the investment funds. Very challenging legal structures too, like an entity was needed for each funded startup. Way too complicated of a business model, and lack of demand for it ultimately.

It died because: It was too challenging and exhausting, went nowhere ultimately, bad business model.

Lesson learned: Go with a simpler business model.

**3- Written test prep for pilots**

Description/background: I’m a licensed hot air balloon pilot, and I wanted to build a tool to help pilots study for the written pilot tests they take as part of the private pilot license in the USA.

Good: Easy and clear marketing ideas, something I myself could use and be passionate about. 

Bad: Nothing really, I think I could have made it work in retrospect. 

It died because: I didn’t pursue it after talking to a certified flight instructor about the idea, and he told me it already existed and not to pursue it. I didn’t know better, and gave up on it then.

Lesson learned: Don’t refrain from building something just because it already exists! That means there is a need for it. Instead figure out how to “build a better mouse trap.”

**4- A directory of startup related tools**

Description/background: So many startups have weird names, and my memory sucks, so I wanted to keep a list of startups/tools to use, and decided to make it public.

Good: This was back in the glory days of Product Hunt and Betalist, and I was able to get 500 people on the wait list from Betalist, and 15,000 unique visitors from the Product Hunt launch, so I had instant traction. It was a fun project and I was able to help other people find cool tools. 

Bad: A fair amount of work for not a ton of money. I averaged maybe $500 in income a month from it, from affiliate links and promoting a dev agency in the weekly emails. Doing a weekly newsletter got tiresome.

It died because: It never died actually, I had other projects I wanted to focus on it and I sold it to help pay off the aforementioned credit card debt!

Lesson learned: Figure out better ways to monetize a site like that. I should have focused on SEO and made it into a G2 for startups, basically, as it had a great domain rating. 

**5- Feedback on websites**

Description/background: The online dating profile review startup was inspired by a website feedback service, and after using that myself and sites like usertesting, I wanted to build my own.

Good: It really helped some people. That felt great. And I enjoy giving feedback to founders, so I would often help review the sites myself. 

Bad: User acquisition wasn’t easy for me. And the profit margin was lousy, since you have to pay reviewers. And it felt kinda scummy because I couldn’t pay the reviewers a lot for their time. No recurring revenue and customers only ordered a couple of times at most. I think my best month was like $1500. 

It died because: I actually sold it to someone who added it to their company portfolio and improved it.

Lesson learned: Focus on businesses with recurring revenue.

**6- Facility management app**

Description/background: I knew a guy locally from an entrepreneur organization and he had a facility management company, with a proprietary tool to help manage the properties, and he asked me to come on to bring it to market as a standalone SaaS. Sounded great to me at the time.

Good: It was a really interesting project, and I was able to work with a cool team. We raised $250k or so. And I got a small salary! It felt like a great idea, with a clear go-to-market plan.

Bad: It was complicated to build, really complicated. We ran out of money twice. Marketing it turned out to be brutal. We could get meetings but no one would buy it. It required too much data set up by the facility management team at each property. 

It died because: No PMF. I left the project after talking to 20+ facility managers about the idea and what concerns they had with it. They basically shredded the idea. I should have gotten that feedback first.

Lesson learned: Don’t assume a company’s internal tool is a validated idea.

**7- Lead gen / employee research tool**

Description/background: I figured out a better way to find employee contact info at companies, learned Bubble, and built the tool.

Good: My first time building my own startup instead of hiring a developer, which was awesome. I learned a LOT and really pushed my limits in many ways. And i had a neat tool that worked, and could really research employees at companies and find leads not in other databases.

Bad: The UX/UI sucked. People were used to leads databases, and this was an unusual tool, and how it worked (taking time to find leads instead of instantly showing them from a database) just didn’t jive with users. It had bugs, too. First time developer! Signups but no sales. 

It died because: I gave up on it, and thought what can I do with the tool myself to turn the resulting data into a product? So I pivoted…

Lesson learned: Validate your tool idea better before building it.

**8- Company name casualizer**

Description/background: Marketers will have huge lists of targets, with company names like “Vacord Industries, LLC.” and use the company name as a variable in otureach campaigns, but need to clean it up to be more casual like just “Vacord” so the emails can be more like “Hey Jack, how’s your xyz at Vacord?” Instead of “Hey Jack, how’s xyz at Vacord Industries, LLC.?”

Good: People said they’d pay me for it before I tried to build it. I could use it myself. Felt validated, as I talked to a lot of people before working on the idea, and a good percentage said they were interested.

Bad: It was a distraction from other projects. I thought I could build it quickly and get quick cash, whcih never works out. 

It died because: I stopped working on it because I got stuck technically, and felt like I should focus on my main project instead.

Lesson learned:  There is no quick money in this world.

**9- Research on recently funded companies**

Description/background: Inspired by other services who researched employees at recently funded companies, I knew my custom research tool (startup #7 above!) could do a better job finding the employees.

Good: I got customers quickly! It was pretty easy to execute. And it was a pretty simple idea to test and put out there.

Bad: Churn was terrible. Data was delivered to customers weekly in a big CSV file, which required too much work on their end to turn into usable contact info. I got to $550 MRR and never went beyond that. Marketing proved a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.

It died because: I did a friends and family round and the runway ran out. I was so stressed and it felt like Sysiphus trying to get the business model to work, so I pivoted again…

Lesson learned: Just because someone else is doing something similar and you think you can do it better, doesn’t mean you’ll do as well at the startup that inspired you.

**10- SaaS company database for marketers**

Description/background: Trying to figure out what else I could do with that research tool, someone told me that leads at SaaS companies were hard to find, so I focused on that.

Good: I validated the idea properly, talked to a ton of people, and got people to pay for access *before* I built it, so I felt good about it. It’s easier to market than anything else has been, and it’s got traction. People are willing to buy $997 lifetime deals to support the project and get access to it, and things are really positive with it overall. Hearing new users say “I’m really glad we found your tool” is huge to me. 

Bad: It’s a huge project. I have to balance time between building/improving the research system, building/improving the custom database, marketing it, and researching the companies. So that can be overwhelming.

It died because: Not dead! This is my main project, and it’s growing slowly. I’m starting a new marketing push to try to scale faster

Lesson learned: Validate validate validate before building. This is the ultimate lesson over ten years. Make sure people care before you build anything. Don’t be scared to talk to people and have them poopoo your idea. And get payments before you build to make sure people really want your startup idea. Else you’re wasting your time and money building something that won’t work in the market.

\----

This isn’t even all of them, honestly, there are a few more that never really got out of the idea stage and to a MVP. Hopefully this post can help someone learn how to do their current/next startup a little better and avoid some heartache.

1h6bnj8,Don't quit your job - even if you have savings,"I know this has been said a million times. But I wanted to share my personal story here to make a point.

**Don't quit your job if you don't have a good alternative stream of income yet. It doesn't matter if you have savings.** 

**Here's my story:**

I saved up 1 year of runway, quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Thailand. At that point my SaaS was doing €75 MRR (yes you read that right, lol) and the plan was to go full-time on that.

Guess what: I failed to scale it into something meaningful.

After two months i started to feel the pressure financially. Even though I still had plenty of runway. 

But I underestimated the psychological aspects of this. ""What if in two months from now I still don't reach a significant number?"" 

So I decided to offer my skills as a service instead (Read: Freelancing).

I've worked as a product designer for ten years, so I knew I could rather easily make money with it. 

Monetising a product is so hard. Monetising your skills: Much easier. 

And for me, this changed everything. 

The money from freelancing gave me so much headspace to pursue my own ideas. I stopped caring whether my SaaS ideas would succeed or not. Whether I didn't have a sustainable product in 3 months from now or in 12 months.

Did I succeed in building a Saas? Not yet. Maybe never. I actually realised I love the freelance product design work much more than building my own SaaS. 

But that's besides the point.

What I'm telling you now i ""knew"" all along. But you can see by my actions I was naive enough to believe it doesn't apply to me. 

As I'm typing this I literally burned through my savings - but because of the freelancing work I made them back 2 fold.  

I don't want to imagine my state of mind had I not chosen to go the freelancing route. 

I'm not saying you can't do it - there are exceptions - but most will probably fail miserably and burn through all their savings.  

Or, as I read somewhere online: ""To thrive, you must first survive"" 

What I would've done differently:

* Start taking on freelance work much earlier while I was still full time (it takes time to build your presence &amp; trust)
* Quit only once I scaled my SaaS to a point where I couldn't justify having a full time job anymore
* Experiment with other income streams much sooner (e.g infoproducts)  

Hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake as I did!

1h6r9vv,First 100 users for my app in a couple of weeks -Lessons learned so far,"It’s incredibly exciting to hit my first 100 users, and I’m especially proud because I did it without any paid advertising! Knowing that people are actually using and paying for my app is such a motivating feeling.

I wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned so far. Reddit communities like this one have been a huge source of advice and support for me as a solo founder, so I hope this helps someone else:

1. **Remember the Problem You’re Solving** It’s easy to get distracted by all the moving parts of running a startup. Stay grounded by focusing on the problem you set out to solve and build around that.
2. **Go to Your Community First** Your community is your best resource when starting out. Listen to them, engage with them, and let their feedback shape your product.
3. **Prioritize Your Clients** Your clients/users are the heart of your business. Everything else—fundraising, branding, or scaling—comes second to making sure you’re solving their problems in a way they love.
4. **You Have the Time** Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to quit your job immediately to make progress. I’ve been building this while working a 9–5, and with consistency and discipline, you can often move faster than well-resourced companies. (I know because I work in tech!)
5. **You’re More Qualified Than You Think** Imposter syndrome is real, but you’ll be surprised at how much your skills and experiences have prepared you to succeed. Trust yourself.
6. **Focus on the Product** It’s tempting to get bogged down in the bells and whistles of running a startup—branding, perfect pitch decks, etc. But at the end of the day, none of that matters if you’re not building a product people love.

To anyone out there grinding away, keep at it. Progress may feel slow at times, but it’s worth it when you see your hard work resonating with real users.

Like the title says, we're a AI SaaS startup in the AI voice/video space stuck at $8-10k MRR for about a year now, for a while I got pretty complacent with where we were and didn't focus on growth which was completely my mistake. Looking to rectify this.

  
We've been here for the last 3.5 years and are constantly mentioned as the Top 10 tools in our space (AI voice/video), although the top 3-5 folks is where all the money is accumulated (just like always). 

Our strongsuite vs competitors is SEO, which is where we're doing a lot better than some, but they seem to be getting more traffic, revenue (1 competitor hit $1m ARR in 6 months using YouTube &amp; Google ads only) which is pretty mind boggling to me. 

So we're planning to run YT, Google ads and an extensive competitor research stint, that'll help us replicate this. 

Any who was in a similar situation have any advice on this?

1h6iy9o,An Inspiring Startup Story with a Twist,"**It started with a trip.**

In the spring of 2023, a startup founder &amp; CEO boarded a flight to Silicon Valley. At that time, AI for startups felt more like a buzzword than a business necessity. For his fast-growing startup, it seemed smarter to stick to proven strategies, keep costs lean, and avoid distractions. 

“Let the early adopters gamble,” he thought. “We’ll step in later if AI turns out to be more than just a trend.”

But Silicon Valley has a way of flipping your perspective.

Over the next few days of meetings, coffees and late-night conversations with seasoned founders, investors, and technologists, this CEO heard a message he couldn’t ignore. These weren’t just dreamers — they were doers and builders with a track record of spotting paradigm shifts before they happened. 

And they all agreed on one thing: 

**AI isn’t a trend — it’s the next big shift.**

They compared it to the internet boom of the ’90s and the rise of smartphones in the 2000s. “This isn’t about efficiency,” one founder told him. “It’s about survival. If you’re not using AI, you’re already behind.”

By the time his plane touched back down, he was no longer a skeptic. He had a new mission: bring AI into his business before it was too late.

Within months, his company had completely transformed. They reorganized teams, launched AI experiments, and rewrote their marketing playbook to make AI a cornerstone of their strategy. 

What happened next?

By early 2024, his company had transformed:

* **3.3 billion ad impressions** driven by AI-powered campaigns.
* **40% better ROI** on video ads, while cutting production costs.
* **Freed-up resources** for bold, creative projects that scaled their impact.

That CEO is Anton Pavlovsky, and the company in the story is Headway, a Ukrainian edtech startup leading the way in AI-driven growth.

But this story isn’t just about Headway. It’s about what AI can do for your business—if you start today.",2,startups,1733326668.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6iy9o/an_inspiring_startup_story_with_a_twist/

We are building a tool to create automated product catalogs. Here’s how it will work-

You give us a google sheets link to your products which has the product name, image, description, price etc. 

You can either upload a png of your catalog background or we can import your designed template from canva.

We provide you with a drag/drop interface where you can position your product info in your imported template.

We generate your entire catalog in the same format that you specified. All the products in the excel will be automatically placed and your catalog will be generated.

Henceforth, you make any changes to your excel, your catalog will be updated.

You can download your catalog as a pdf

My question - who can be our customers? We have spoken to solopreneurs, distributors, wholesellers, retailers etc.

While catalog generation and updation is a bottleneck for them, they want it as a service. Where we create excel, create catalog template and generate catalogs for them.

1h5oz6l,The Product-Market-Fit confirmation I could only dream about,"Hey there! I'm solo building my SaaS for more than 2 years now, selling for 13 months already. I had a strong vision from the very beginning, as I badly wanted this kind of app for myself - so no pivots, no researching - building for myself and a wider group that I had a hunch, that must exist somewhere...

It's an investments monitoring app behind a subscription, so a pretty crowded space already, but I decided to just do my thing, without copying others.

I had no followers, no friendly influencers, no high karma on Reddit or HackerNews. So veery slowly, through combination of very low key SEO, monitoring and giving legit answers on Reddit, and some local networking I've started to grow a small user base.

At some point, somebody recommended my app to a local ""retired"" influencer, who still has a pretty good following and an active community. He liked it, started a trial and **bought** a subscription. His community took notice, but it wasn't a drove of users. I've slowly racked up around 200 users in a year, with only a quarter out of this community. I'm writing this, because he didn't bring me droves of users, but brought me something more important - trust and credibility - which I was able to build upon with fast pace of updates and quick and friendly founder support.

Now, to the PMF part.

Last week I've started a ""black weeks"" promo, where anyone, including my current users, can pay for 4 years up-front and buy a license for life. So not a regular LTD. And guess what happened...

20% of my existing users cancelled their subscriptions and purchased the lifetime. They liked it so much, they decided they'll be using it for more than 4 years, and believed I won't disappear before that. If that's not a definition of Product-Market-Fit, I don't know what is...

And when I came with the product to a financial fare this weekend, people who didn't know me, or the influencer even, was very interested, excited even to try it out, as it's pretty feature-full at this point.

I'm in a little nirvana-like state now, and wanted to share this success. My morale 4 weeks ago was medium at best, as building the app, marketing, design work, literally everything is dragging slowly and wears me down. But I've persevered, didn't give up, and was able to experience this. It's still a small step on a road to a fully bootstrapped business, but I'll have a marketing budget now, and maybe even will outsource some work to move a bit faster. 

But most importantly, I know have a strong feeling, I'm building something meaningful.

And I wish you all experience the same thing! (unless you already did ;)) 🚀",86,startups,1733237070.0,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5oz6l/the_productmarketfit_confirmation_i_could_only/
1h6cqec,Co-Founders or Investors for SMBs,"
I’m a software engineer based in Australia with startup experience—I ran a small company with 5 employees for 3 years and sold it 10 years ago.

I’ve built an AI app, available only on the App Store, for small businesses like plumbers and electricians. The app helps with:

Invoicing: For example, a plumber can say, “Just fixed John Doe's dishwasher, bill him $200,” and it generates the invoice.

Task management and client tracking

Ad campaigns: Users can ask the AI to set up a Facebook ad to find customers nearby.

Website updates: Easily update pricing or services with voice commands.

The app is live but still in early stages. Some people downloaded it, but no one has registered yet. I also need to add key features like ad campaign tools.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

Should I look for co-founders with skills in online ads (like Google or Facebook Ads) or technical expertise to help grow it?

Or should I focus on finding investors so I can hire a dev team and salespeople?

What’s the smarter choice to grow from here? If co-founders are the answer, how do I find the right ones? If it’s investors, where do I start without a user base?

I’d really appreciate your advice. Thanks!

1h6cn1l,"36 startup ideas found by analyzing podcasts (problem, solution &amp; source episode)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that SaaS product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focusing on the podcast technology full-time instead.

I'm a long-time lurker and poster of r/startups and thought this would make for some interesting content and inspiration for folks.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/API.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought it would be interesting to post some of the ideas extracted so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

A word of warning before anyone complains – this is a big mixture of tech, ai, non-tech, local services, etc. ideas:

1. Some of the ideas are completely mundane, but realistic (e.g. local window cleaning service)
2. Some of the ideas are completely insane, blue sky, but sound super interesting

1h6ar6x,Startup Wisdom: Done is Better Than Perfect,"Hey there, startup enthusiasts and fellow entrepreneurs,

I’ve got some advice to share that’s been crucial for our team and might be valuable for yours too. The golden rule? “Done is better than perfect.” Don’t get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100. Then, based on user feedback, you can decide whether to continue investing in improving the product or to pivot.

Another tip is to create a landing page as soon as possible to start engaging with your users. This helps you gather valuable insights and build a community around your product from the get-go.

If you’re in a situation where you don’t have the coding skills or aren’t sure how to create a landing page, check out my profile. Our team has developed an AI-powered low-code platform that can generate front-end pages through conversation.",2,startups,1733297927.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h6ar6x/startup_wisdom_done_is_better_than_perfect/
1h5y72m,"Validation by pre-selling before building: how to do it for an idea that is not necessarily of the ""exciting"", ""shut up and take my money"" kind?","So every book on startups, and a lot of posts here suggest that one should first go and find customers to (pre-) sell the product to before even building it. They say, if your potential customers are excited about it enough to be willing to pay for you to build it - it's a validation that your idea is actually worth building. Also, that might help choosing what goes into the MVP first, and what doesn't.

This makes sense to me in general, but leaves some doubts. For example, what about entering an existing market with established competitors? What if it's not one of those products that people instantly get excited about and reach for their wallets? What if it's a potentially good lifestyle business to bootstrap but it needs to demonstrate its value first with some evidence for people to decide to use it? What if what differentiates my product is something that can only be proven when it exists? Should I still be trying to sell this kind of ""wishful thinking""?

So many ""whats"" and ""ifs""!

Here is an **example**. Let's say my differentiator in a SaaS app is the uptime that is higher than competitors', and EU compliance important for the FinTech companies. While it's more or less binary with the compliance (it's either compliant or not - with some grey areas in between), with things like uptime it might take some time until my product reaches the desired levels, and it might be hard for the MVP or the first version(s) to have that right away. How do I communicate it? Do I tell the potential customers that it's what I am aiming for in the future?..

As a developer it's really hard for me to approach this phase, with so much ambiguity and without actually going and building that MVP first - which I know is most likely a waste of time if I haven't talked to customers first. I cannot shrug off this feeling this is a chicken and egg problem.

Any wise words from the community? Thank you",9,startups,1733260026.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5y72m/validation_by_preselling_before_building_how_to/

1h5azfu,We should have started with a technical co-founder,"We're running a marketplace in the parenting space. We've made it pretty far - 1,300 customers with 2,200 transactions with $870k GMV since Jan 1, 2024. We've found the main challenges, iterated the product, found our pricing, found our growth channels, figured out the sales cycle. We raised a little angel funding.

I'm a product manager + UX designer + longtime founder and I thought maybe this time I was ""technical enough"" to be able to communicate clearly and get what I needed from a good team of engineers. And, for the most part, that did work out. We've got a solid product - basic features, but enough to support a decent amount of our TAM at a lower price than the competition. Our marketplace's SaaS is the Toyota Camry of our space. You can get a Cadillac if you want, it's available, but most people just need and want a Camry, so we do pretty well. Maybe one day we'll build a Cadillac (but maybe not).

We should have started with a technical co-founder, though. We have to pay for every line of code, and rely on the casual pace of hourly workers to get our iterations out. When a technical problem pops up, it's hard to get the engineers to care like we do. Again, I have no shade for our engineering team - they have done great work and we got lucky with this team of contractors. The incentives are just not aligned, and they aren't interested in a founder position.

Even with some traction, marketplaces are not easy. And they take awhile to spin up. Once the Camry features were built, we spun down production, trying to save runway. But it's hard to run a tech product without the reliable attention of engineers. We should be sprinting toward greatness, but we're moving slowly. 

I don't think it's too late, though. I still think we could find somebody. We're locked into our PHP/JS stack, though, so it's hard to find the right person. I'm on the YC co-founder matching site, but it's not really what we need. I'm not sure how many people on there are really that serious, and Laravel/Nuxt/Vue doesn't seem popular. 

The opportunity in front of us is a solid mid-market business. $10-100M ARR is possible, 4-10X multiples for acquisitions. Likely not VC scale, but that's fine with us - we'd rather keep the equity with the founders and eventually get to a work/life/salary balance as we steer toward a one-day acquisition.

Is there anyone out there who has navigated this moment before? Picked up a late-stage technical co-founder after the basic product was already built? Do you have any advice for me?",67,startups,1733187116.0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5azfu/we_should_have_started_with_a_technical_cofounder/

1h5yefu,"Am I thinking correctly about how to develop an ideal client profile for a tool to help websites deal with bot traffic? 
","We have a new website management tool, we originally developed it with an ICP of major content sites so they could automate content licensing to AI companies. Basically a dynamic bot paywall that's invisible to humans.

As we were building we discovered a near competitor had raised tens of millions to blanket that niche. We realized we couldn't outmarket or outsell them, and that we couldn't afford to mature our product to the extent required to engage that niche with that kind of funded competition. We'd call someone only to find they were already using the competitor tool. That meant we'd have to chase a different niche to start with.

We pivoted into cost management for small-medium websites with improved analytics and traffic controls so that operators could understand the invisible half of their traffic that traditional human analytics don't expose, and apply rules to that traffic to save hosting costs.

But we're not going to save them a huge amount (50% of $50/mo is only $25, not hugely motivating) at low traffic levels, and people aren't necessarily going to trust us (yet) with a busy site. While onboarding small independent site operators is easy, finding them to get the conversation going is time consuming, and the benefits to both side exist but aren't that exciting.

And besides, everyone we talk to is most interested in the monetizing bots aspect anyway, with operating cost savings being an afterthought. But the payment funnels are dependent on the management tools, so we have to mature the management tools first.

So we started looking at channel partnerships with web dev / marketing / SEO MSPs who have hundreds of existing client sites they're managing. The marketing/SEO functions get better analytics they can use internally, they can sell us down to their clients against the site management features, generating some cash flow while we finish building the monetization funnel. That's starting to get some good interest, but is going to take a lot of manual work to get the MSPs from intrigued to buying. Which is fine, that's part of the game.

But now we're starting to get major data centers and webhosts looking at us to resell our product into their client channels. Very positive sentiment but we're still in need of maturing the product up to the level that these major parties can confidently market us to their existing clients.

In going on this market discovery journey with different potential client segments, I've realized the market is far larger than ""just"" a bot paywall. While people get most excited about converting that cohort into revenues, it's really just the smallest portion of what's possible. I'm not sure I should say how openly at this point, but people are pointing me towards features and capabilities that are pretty trivial for us to implement in our application model, but provide hugely powerful tools for how websites handle bot traffic. We just have to get the client base built up so we can afford the dev costs of those features.

I think the answer is to use MSPs to get early traction and cash flow against the benefits they can see immediately, proving we have a market appetite for our solution, and use that traction to drive maturing the product until we can partner with the DCs and webhosts to scale against the payment funnels and more advanced features people are requesting.

And since the content sites we originally wanted to deliver to will be using those DCs and webhosts anyway, getting set up as channel partners for the DCs and hosts to resell means that we have access to our original target ICP anyway.

Does this approach make sense?

Am I missing something here?

Am I thinking about it the right way?

What do you guys think?

1h5ycm3,P&amp;L Spending Analyzer,"**Pitch:**  
Stealth AI is your personal expense optimizer. It analyzes your P&amp;L, finds cheaper alternatives for every expense, rates the hassle of switching (A+ to F), and delivers monthly reports with actionable savings. It even scours the web and user reviews to ensure smarter spending decisions. Save money without the headaches—effortlessly.

# Why Now?

* **Economic Pressure**: Businesses are facing tighter margins and growing pressure to cut costs amidst economic uncertainty.
* **AI Accessibility**: Advances in AI and data integration make it easier than ever to analyze, compare, and optimize spending at scale.
* **Decision Overload**: Business owners are overwhelmed by countless service options and subscription costs; they need automated, data-driven solutions.
* **Demand for Efficiency**: Companies are increasingly seeking tools to streamline operations, reduce waste, and maximize ROI.

# Competition

* **Existing Tools**: Tools like Mint, QuickBooks, or Expensify offer expense tracking but don’t actively optimize spending or assess switchability.
* **Consultants**: Expense optimization firms exist but are costly and often require significant manual input.
* **DIY Research**: Most businesses rely on manual comparisons and reviews, which is time-consuming and prone to missed opportunities.

**Edge of Stealth AI**: By combining automated expense analysis, real-time pricing from the web, and community insights (e.g., Reddit), Stealth AI creates a unique value proposition that is both cost-effective and proactive—an unmet need in the market.**""**",0,startups,1733260414.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h5ycm3/pl_spending_analyzer/

1h5kgil,What Do Startup Founders Look for in a Banking Partner? Your Insights Needed!,"Hi r/startups!

I’m doing a short write-up on how banks can better serve startup founders. Having worked in the startup world and as a VC, I’ve seen a lot of frustration with banking partners—things like slow onboarding, lack of support, or tools that don’t fit founders’ needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts to help shed light on what really matters to founders when choosing a bank.

If you’re a founder, here are a few quick questions I’d love your input on:
	1.	Who do you currently bank with, and why did you choose them?
	2.	What were the most important factors in choosing your bank (e.g., fast onboarding, reputation, digital tools)?
	3.	What’s one thing you wish your banking partner did better?
	4.	At what stage of growth did having a strong banking relationship become critical for your startup?

Feel free to answer any or all of these! Your insights will go into a write-up I’m working on, and I’m happy to share the findings if you’re interested—just let me know in the comments.

1h4smhz,How I made a high tech salary in my first selling month,"For over 7 years I worked as a full-stack developer, helping other companies bring their ideas to life. But one day, I thought *“Why not try making my own dream come true?”*. That’s when I decided to quit my job and start my own journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

At first, it wasn’t easy. I didn’t make any money for months and had no idea where to start. I felt lost. Then, I decided to focus on something popular and trending. AI was everywhere, and ChatGPT was the most used AI platform. So I looked into it and I found the OpenAI community forum where people had been asking for features that weren’t being added.

That gave me an idea. Why not build those features myself? I created a Chrome extension and I worked on some of the most requested features, like:

* Downloading the advanced voice mode and messages as MP3

It took me about a week to build the first version, and when I published it, the response was incredible. People loved it! Some even said things like, *“You’re a lifesaver!”* That’s when I realized I had something that could not only help people but also turn into a real business.

I kept the first version free to see how people would respond. Many users have been downloading my extension, which prompted Chrome to review it to determine if it qualified for the featured badge. I received the badge, and it has significantly boosted traffic to my extension ever since.

After all the positive feedback, I launched a paid version one month ago. A few minutes after publishing it, I made my first sale! That moment was so exciting, and it motivated me to keep going.

I already have over 4,000 users and have made more than $4,500 in my first selling month. I’ve decided to release 1-2 new features every month to keep improving the extension based on what users ask for.

I also created the same extension for Firefox and Edge users because many people have been asking for it!

I also started a Reddit community, where I share updates, sales, discount codes, and ideas for new features. It’s been awesome to connect with users directly and get their feedback.

Additionally, I’ve started working on another extension for Claude, which I’m hoping will be as successful as this one.

**My message to you is this: never give up on your dreams. It might feel impossible at first, but with patience, hard work, and some creativity, you can make it happen.**

I hope this inspires you to go after what you want. Good luck to all of us!

1h5vtd2,"Had my producthunt launch yesterday, low upvotes but lots of traffic, what's next?","Hey everyone, I had my product hunt launch yesterday, didn't market it at all and just wanted to see what kind of traffic/feedback I would get. Even though the upvotes were low at \~15, the amount of traffic was pretty decent spiking at 1,100 DAU which was amazing. This makes me think 2 things. Firstly, lots of people  were intrigued enough to try the app and didn't really like it so they didn't upvote. But secondly, the DAU dropped today to about 300 today after the launch with plenty of returning users, way more than actually upvoted, which means way more users got value then participated in upvoting on product hunt. 

My question is basically, whats next? My app is somewhat unique in that it requires no account for you to use the app, so I don't have a huge email list (even though I do plan on reaching out to users that actually logged in). The app relies on the user getting enough value out of the product to log in and save their work and also use advanced AI features. That means that I'm really looking to just get as much traffic as possible, hoping for conversions, and eventually monetizing the app? Outside of reaching out to current users for feedback, implementing it, and perhaps some actual marketing, are there any other viable strategies that I could use?

* male, 30 years old

I've often read and seen people using avatars for their marketing strategy. I undestand that bringing your target audience 'into live' is nice to get a better feeling of what they are like and ultimately how to get in touch with them. But from my understanding most of the characteristics is based on pure speculation and assumptions. Let's take my example with the 30 year old male. I assume he reads the financial times so it seems like a good idea to tailor an ad campaign to his needs and show it in the financial times. If I base my whole campaign on my speculation it can go badly wrong if hes not reading the assumed magazine.

1h54n5u,Need Advice: Working for a Startup with No Pay (yet) – Stocks vs. Profit Sharing?,"Hey everyone,

I recently started working for a brand-new startup. There’s no funding yet, and the only promise is stock options. We’re not launching until early next year (not promoting anything).

Here’s the situation:  
The founder sent out an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) promising stock options 12 months after we launch, based on how much work we’ve put into the company. Right now, he’s unable to pay more money because he’s fighting stage four kidney cancer, and his savings are going toward his treatment.

The MOU states **""15 to 20 hours a week for zero compensation,""** which doesn’t sit well with me. I’m not an entrepreneur, and the business world is new to me. I’m a software engineer—I can code fast and efficiently—but this feels like uncharted territory.

I’m currently negotiating with the founder. I told him I’m not looking for a salary but would prefer a percentage of the profit every month. He said no, explaining it could deter future investors. (Honestly, I’m skeptical about investors ever coming into the picture since this is a SaaS company.)

He keeps pushing the idea of stock options and a salary once the company goes full-time. In my eyes, **stocks only have value once you sell them and have actual cash in hand.**

He’s also offered $500–$1000 a month, but I’d honestly prefer that money go toward his chemo so he can focus on beating cancer. (he's not lying about cancer, its real for a fact).

So, here’s my question:

* Do you think stock options are fair compensation for a startup at this stage?
* Does this MOU seem reasonable, or does it feel like it could be taking advantage of the team?

I had an idea that I wrote down all those years ago for an e-commerce platform that allows 3D modelers to directly sell physical models without having to deal with manufacturing on their end. Think RedBubble but for 3D artists. I reintroduced myself to the idea and fully thought through it and now I think it is a viable startup idea.

Hey guys, I have an app idea but I’m not sure if it’s something people would want. Which is where I need your help.

**The Problem I'm Addressing**

Social Media has made it really difficult to have great individual connections with people. Often, you are interacting with someone on a comment thread or reacting to someone else's post. More and more people feel isolated and lack real friendships.

There are thousands of friend-making apps out there. From well-known like ""Bumble BFF"" to relatively small and niche like ""Hey VINA"". But the problem in my opinion with all these apps is that they don't allow for genuine one-on-one interactions and exploring the other person's interests.

In apps like Bumble BFF, you have to make a profile with your interests, hobbies, etc. and you hope that people like your profile enough to match with you so you can send a message. This leads to few people with the ""perfect profile"" getting a lot of matches and many few barely a couple and puts pressure and anxiety on people who are really feeling lonely to make the ""perfect profile"". Similar to how skewed dating apps are. Conversely, if the friend-making app is based on common hobbies or interests, you're in a group setting where, depending on the size, it can be almost impossible to know any individual really well.

**The Audience It's For**

1. Those who are looking to make a real friendship but have found no success on other well-known friend-making apps.
2. Those who have trouble making conversation or keeping it going and would love a helping hand in improving this skill.
3. Those who are new to a place and don't know anyone there.
4. Those that feeling disconnected or looking for a fun, low-pressure way to make new connections.

**My Solution**

Rather than make another social media app masquerading as a friend-making app, My focus is on building a chat app instead where you get randomly matched with one and only one new person every week. And your goal is to get to know them as much as possible.

If the conversation stagnates, the built-in A.I. (I know, I know another ""A.I. app"") would suggest tips based on the conversation between the two users to keep the chat engaging. To better help you visualize my idea and answer any major questions in your mind, I have made a landing page. Let me know if you wanna check it out.

1h4uu0k,What marketing skills are required for joining early startups? ,"Hi :) 

  
I'm a 31, from Eastern Europe, working in the mobile gaming as a marketing director for a major company. I've been in the industry for more than 7 years now, with previous background in iGaming. I would say my skillset evolves around product marketing, brand marketing, user research, sales enablements, etc. 

I'm quite happy working in the company where I am right now and we have some very ambitious plans for 2025 - new game launches, expansions to other markets, etc. However, I am tempted for 2026, if all goes well, to pivot and look for a new challenge in a startup environment. My main reason for this desire is my wish to be a part of something new that has potential to grow and make an impact in its field. 

Considering this, I have several questions: 

1. Considering my skillset, what do you think I should focus on to make me more useful for a startup environment where, afaik, people juggle multiple tasks. Should I consider being better at UI/UX learning Canva for example, or becoming better at product management? Or maybe business development? Or something else? :) 
2. I don't think I have a golden idea for a startup that will go to the moon (yet. :D ) so how would you approach finding partners to join at an early stage? I've seen event like **EU-Startups Summit** \- what's your experience from similar events in terms of networking? 
3. What would you say are the biggest risks and challenges I'd face when I switch from the corporate life I have now to moving to a startup environment? Besides the obvious ones of the risks associated with the project's success, having to wear multiple hats and not having the benefits of the big, corporate life. 

  
Maybe lastly, I don't think I would be looking only at gaming or marketing-related startups, I would be more open to explore various areas where I could make an impact and be part of something with big potential.

1h4ta7r,Please advise ,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the early stages of building an MVP for my startup, and could really use some advice and encouragement from this amazing community.

A bit about my startup: My company is focused on revolutionizing agricultural trade and beyond. Our vision is to empower smallholder farmers by connecting them with global buyers through a blockchain-integrated web portal.

The platform aims to provide transparency, secure transactions through smart contracts, and traceability for agricultural exports.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping the project and making good progress on the MVP, but l've hit some financial roadblocks.
It's been a challenge balancing the development costs while maintaining the momentum of the project.

What I'm looking for:

Advice on getting investors after completing the MVP: For those of you who've been here before, how did you approach investors at this stage? What worked for you?

Insights on managing and overcoming financial constraints while building the MVP.

Suggestions on presenting blockchain as a key feature to investors who might not be tech-savvy.

My end goal is to not only attract investment but also ensure that this platform genuinely transforms the lives of farmers and provides buyers with a more reliable supply chain.

To anyone who has been in my shoes: how did you push through the tough times? Any advice, personal experiences, or strategies to keep going would mean the world.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or even connect further if you're interested in this space.",1,startups,1733140492.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4ta7r/please_advise/

I'm living that moment that perhaps many of you know - when you can't tell if you're banging your head against a wall or just knocking on the wrong door.

I'm an Italian founder, and over the last few months, I've been experiencing a consuming frustration. I built an AI-powered HR Tech solution, and every demo ends with ""This is fantastic!"", ""This is exactly what we need!"", followed by months of ""We're waiting for approval"", ""The manager hasn't responded""... and then silence.

**What's driving me crazy is that I can't figure out if:**

* The product isn't really solving a problem (but why is all reviews positive?)
* The pricing is wrong (but $600 for 100 assessments seems reasonable)
* Or simply... it's Italy

**I even have a $70k deal with a major Italian company that turned into ghosting** after they accepted the economic proposal. Two weeks of silence after sending the contract. It's frustrating not even being able to get a clear ""no"".

**I've saved up $4k and I'm seriously thinking about going all-in and flying to the States.** Not to escape, but to understand once and for all if the problem is my product or if it's the Italian market which, as the only country with just one unicorn, might not be ready.

Has anyone experienced a similar situation? How did you figure out if it was time to seek validation in more dynamic markets? I need to connect with those who've been through this.

I'm not looking for shortcuts or magic solutions. **Just the chance to test my product in a market where a ""yes"" means yes and a ""no"" means no.** And maybe some guidance from those who've already made this leap.",0,startups,1733129921.0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h4qtp3/founder_caught_between_amazing_product_and_0/

Navigating the startup world can be overwhelming, especially when resources are scattered and hard to find. As a native Detroiter and lifelong Michigander, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to uncover statewide resources like co-working spaces, funding opportunities, accelerators, grants, and events. If you’re not from a specific region or deeply connected, these opportunities can feel hidden.

So, I decided to create a free, searchable directory of Michigan startup resources. It’s designed for entrepreneurs and founders to quickly filter resources by region and tags, making it easy to find exactly what you need—no endless Googling or outdated lists.

This started as a personal project to help me organize everything, but I realized how much value it could provide to others in the startup ecosystem. My goal is to keep it updated and add even more resources over time.

1h4daw1,Is a patent or IP necessary?,"Hi everyone, I’m building a startup in the healthcare field. I wrote the code during a research year in medical school. I wasn’t enrolled and the school has already said they won’t claim any ownership of the Intellectual Property. 

But a lot of my mentors, who are physicians so aren’t familiar with software startups, advised me to pursue a patent. I’ve heard that software is impossible to patent and usually a copyright is good enough. 

My school, while currently not claiming ownership of the software, says that they are happy to pay the ~$30,000 required to file the patent/IP paperwork as long as I give them full rights to it. 

I don’t want to do that, especially since I have other investors who are happy to cover those costs while only wanting some equity in the company. 

My question is do I really need to file for an IP? If not, what would prevent another company from coming in and doing the same thing I’m trying to do? Other than not having the credibility among the customer base or other external factors like that.

1h488p4,Carta Pricing,"I recently looked into Carta's discounts for early-stage tech startups and thought I'd share what I found, in case it's useful to others. If your startup has up to $1M in funding and 25 stakeholders, you can use Carta for free through their Carta Launch program. All you need to do is sign up.

If you don’t meet those criteria, you’ll need a paid plan. This can be thousands of dollars but includes services like 409A valuations. That being said, you can get a discount for the first year if you haven’t already paid for Carta. For example, Stripe Atlas, which helps you incorporate your startup, offers a 20% discount. Techstars, a global startup accelerator, provides a 30% discount.

There are also ways to get 100% off the first year. For instance, some law firms including Mintz, a litigation powerhouse that works with life sciences, private equity, etc., can help you access Carta for free. Y Combinator, a startup accelerator helping founders make something people want, provides access to a full discount. Additionally, Carta is an alum of Founder Friendly Labs, an equity-free startup accelerator for experienced professionals, and also offers a 100% discount if you're accepted into their program.

Note that none of these options are completely free—Stripe Atlas charges a $500 fee, Techstars takes 6%+ equity, Mintz involves legal fees, Y Combinator takes 7%+ equity, and Founder Friendly Labs charges a $1,990 fee. But depending on your situation, they could still be worth considering.

1h49urb,What’s your top priority for onboarding right after launching a customer-facing service?  ,"Onboarding is the backbone of any customer-facing service.  
No matter how amazing your product is, if users don’t understand it or it takes too long to get started, it’ll quickly become a service no one uses.  

Plus, being too hesitant to show a paywall can hold back revenue, and a trial period that’s too short might stop users from even giving it a chance.  

Here’s what I’ve learned in the first three months of launching my product:  
- Early on, improving onboarding beats developing new features.  
- Letting users start without an account boosted tutorial completion rates by 10%.  
- Don’t fear the paywall—it’s there for a reason.  
- Nobody reads long explanations—let them dive into the experience instead.  
- Open-ended freedom doesn’t work—guide users with a clear first step.  
- Design and fonts? They matter way more than you think.

1h42ybs,"5 Years into my Startup Journey: From DJI to COO of a Startup - Reflecting on Growth, Challenges and Seeking Advice","Hey ​guys,

I wanted to share my startup journey and hear your experiences. Back in college, I landed what many considered a dream job at DJI (the drone company). However, after a year, driven by the desire for faster personal growth, I made the bold decision to join a startup in a completely different industry.

Fast forward 5 years - I'm now the COO of this startup. The journey has been a mixed bag of experiences. On one hand, I've grown tremendously as a professional and leader. The learning curve has been steep, and I've developed skills I never thought I would have. But on the other hand, the financial returns haven't matched the growth, mainly due to our initial industry choice.

Recently, we pivoted our business model. While I'm more excited about our new direction, the lack of consistent business success has started to wear on me. As a COO, I feel the responsibility to maintain a positive outlook for the team, but honestly, my confidence in building a successful business has taken some hits.

The challenging part is balancing between being a strong leader and dealing with these internal doubts. While I believe in our current direction, the past experiences have made me more cautious and sometimes hesitant.

I'm curious to hear from others who've been on similar journeys:

* How do you handle the emotional ups and downs of startup life, especially as a senior executive?
* Has anyone else experienced a major pivot? How did you maintain team morale during the transition?
* For those who've been through prolonged periods without significant business success, what kept you going?

1h4dgoy,Got a long-term idea for a startup but currently 0 customers. Thinking of first creating a high-quality potential customer lead list by collecting email addresses / contacts via sign-up page to obtain a free PDF with some knowledge I consider valuable. How to do this optimally?,"Obvious steps are: 1) create a PDF with the knowledge I want to distribute for free and consider actually useful to prospective future customers, 2) set up a website with a ""register your email"" box such that the PDF will be emailed to them.

That's the easy part.

Questions:

1. I know where my customers can be found (e.g. in some subforums of reddit). But how do I approach them? I don't want to spam a subreddit for that. And DMing them one by one is not efficient and also cumbersome. Also, it's too early to do SEO trying to drive traffic on the website. So, how do I make as many users as possible get to sign up for the free PDF?

2. Instead of making the PDF for free, I could also do a simple A/B test and charge e.g. 0$ for the first group, but 5$, 15$ or perhaps 35$ - not for the money but to see to what degree they would be willing to pay for the PDF. But I think it's a bit too early for that too, I'd prefer first building up the lead list and perhaps then invest into an A/B test for a product that is much closer to the final product than the PDF would be today.

3. I could also promise them some sort of bonus (e.g. a second PDF) if they share also the emails of other interested people (like: ""send this PDF to your friends""). That could potentially increase the number of emails, but it's a somewhat aggressive strategy and I don't know whether others would appreciate if their email is shared with such a third-party service.

4. I could also try to add a small survey between providing the email and obtaining the PDF. But more for trying to figure out what people want in a product rather than finding out their willingness to pay for a later product.

5. Another thing could be to offer a free 30 mins webinar with the same content if people sign-up.

1h45ojy,MVP Creation: How Did You Develop Yours? ,"We’re a startup team currently developing an exciting new AI that can generate frontend web pages through conversation. Before we dive into the full development, we’re focusing on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test our concept and gather early user feedback.

We’d love to hear about your experiences with MVPs:

•  What was your process for creating your MVP?

•  How did you decide on the core features to include?

•  What tools or frameworks did you find most helpful during your MVP development?

•  Any advice for avoiding common pitfalls in MVP creation?

Also, we’re curious to know what you think about our new AI concept. We believe it could revolutionize frontend development by making it more accessible and efficient.

1h3lod0,How do I get first users to sign up?,"I want to build this application that lets meet new people with very specific filters.
Let me try and explain what is the problem I am trying to solve:
Ever since I found myself in a new city/new country for job, I had found it very hard to meet new people. For example I like to football, how do I find person who plays football? or even watches football? How do I people who speak the same language as me? The only way to meet new people that I found was through dating apps, but thats not my intention, I want to meet new people that share same hobby, culture is.

Solution:
Here is how I intend to solve the problem: Every person would write something interesting about their bio. The more descriptive the better. With the help of some LLM I would break down into specific filters. For example:
 I am Bishwash, 24 years old in Gurgaon. I am software engineer as a profession working as a full stack developer. I enjoy playing football on weekends and I like to watch football, support Chelsea. I am originally from Nepal, am fluent in Nepalese and would like to meet Nepali people from the same city. I like to travel a lot and have visited thailand recently.
This would break into filters like: software engineer, Nepali, speaks Nepalese, likes football, supports Chelsea, visited Thailand.
 Now any person who writes: I want to meet someone who plays football in weekend in Gurgaon will find me and connect with me. 

My questions are:
1. Is this a good idea? Are there any apps already doing it?
2. Since it is a community application it wont work if people wont sign up to the application and write their bios. How do I get the first users to sign up?  The way I see is unless there are new people there is virtually zero incentive for user to do the task of adding in their bio.

Thanks a lot for reading everything, all the feedbacks are appreciated!",5,startups,1732998831.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1h3lod0/how_do_i_get_first_users_to_sign_up/

","This startup stuff wasn't some Silicon Valley dream.

I've been experimenting new iterations with min expenses:

1. Started with 5 free credits for all features - no income for 4 month
2. Reduced to 3 credits, then 2 for all features - got about 5 buyers for 2 month
3. Now offering a free trial with 2 credits for one feature -20 buyers for 2 month - 5% of expenses

1h3p96b,How tf am I supposed to compete ,"Hello everyone, I am a 21 yo italian university student and I am really determined to get into the defence industry. I study economics so I have no technical background/skills, but I am learning as much as I can during the night about the specific segment I want to start with. The problem is that, for as much as I can be determined, I feel like I'll never be even capable to compete with the market and break successfully in the industry.

 I'll expand:   
As much as I can study I feel that I wont be able to turn that knowledge into a valid product since I'm only studying online and right now there are some startups in the same sector composed by tens of Phds that work to innovate and create new technologies, advancing at an incredible rate. Just the other day I saw a leaked video of a test conducted by a small chinese startup (operating in the exact same field I want to break into) that was fucking mind blowing. 

 I know that everything is possible and if you don't believe in yourself then nobody will, and in fact I'm hungry, I really am, but please give me some advice on how to overcome this doubts (if possible) and how to make things concrete instead on staying forever on a learning phase.

Their apps are not top level and considered more of mvp or below , while mine is top notch (but still have not lunched).

I posted about the issue before , but now I’m thinking of just reaching out and trying to form a team for 1 startup .

This unfortunately would probably cost me equity as I’m pretty sure i will max at 33.3% if not less .

Have anyone done it ? 

Do you guys think this is a good idea ?

At the end of the day I wanna build a team around the startup so in my thoughts this is not bad .

My ideal route would have been to lunch and beat everyone and then employ the competitors under me without losing equity, but I don’t wanna dream too big and then end up with nothing .

On any given day, over 80  million people  log onto the app. That’s an insane scale. Yet, I came across a stat showing Roblox spends about $138 for every $100 in revenue over the last year. How is this possible? Sure, app stores take their cut, but they don’t seem to spend much on marketing, and with fewer than 10,000 employees, labor costs don’t seem overly excessive either. Smaller games like Fortnite and Minecraft are massively profitable.

1h24jxo,how I learned to sell as a founder (without feeling like a sleazy salesperson),"If you think sales are only for “salespeople,” you’re probably leaving money on the table. After seven years of selling across SMBs, mid-market, and enterprise companies, I've learned sales is a system, not a gamble.

Here’s the truth: sales isn’t about being pushy but solving problems for the right people.

Over the years, I’ve built a simple sales process that any founder can follow:

1. **Stop Selling to Everyone:** Focus only on companies that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). For me, mid-sized companies (50–100 employees) with quick decision-making cycles were the sweet spot.
2. **Make Every Email Count:** Forget long, generic emails. Keep it short, relevant, and with a clear call-to-action. Want to stand out? Add a 30-second video to your email.
3. **Discovery Calls Done Right:** Start every call with Purpose, Agenda, Outcome (POA). Listen more than you talk, qualify fast, and tailor your demo to the customer’s pain points.
4. **Don’t Discount Without a Trade:** If they ask for a discount, ask for something in return—like a testimonial or a longer commitment. Build value instead of slashing prices.
5. **Track Everything, Always:** Sales is a numbers game. If you’re not tracking how many calls, emails, or meetings it takes to close a deal, you’re flying blind.
