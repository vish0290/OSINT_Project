Use the things you've learned from this experience to keep climbing in your career and become a founder/exec yourself to get access to the real money.\\n\\n10,000,000 outstanding shares is a typical number to issue during the initial formation of a Delaware C corp. Institutional investors insist on converting any company into a Delaware C corp before investing since corporate law in Delaware is standardized and well understood. The number of outstanding shares can be wildly more (but unlikely to be less) depending on the age of the startup and the amount of funding taken on. For example, Reddit had something like 187,000,000 shares outstanding pre-IPO.\\n\\nThe employee stock option pool (which is where your shares came from) is typically anywhere from 10% to 20% of the total shares, so 1,000,000 to 2,000,000. Investors make you increase this every funding round to give them confidence that you'll retain top talent.\\n\\nPart of the shares are set aside to secure high-demand execs or consultants (maybe 10%), and the rest is split between the founders of the startup. C-level founder splits can look like 40% for the CEO, 20% for the CTO, 10% for the COO, etc. The CEO is the person held most liable for the success of the company and is first in line for legal action if something goes sideways, so they always get the majority of equity and it's important to understand why this is necessary and okay.\\n\\nAll of the shares I mentioned before are referred to as \\\"common stock\\\". Investors dilute everyone (common stock holders) when they put money into a company. A startup might have taken on as much as 80% dilution by the time a liquidation event (like the one you mentioned) occurs. The percentage of dilution is higher for consumer technology or hard-tech startups and lower for B2B SaaS startups since those generate more revenue in the early days.\\n\\nLet's assume a roughly p90 outcome for startup acquisitions and that your startup is being acquired for $100 million by a Fortune 500 company.\\n\\n$100,000,000 purchase price of startup \\\\* 0.20 remaining value of common stock after dilution (assuming 80% dilution) = $20,000,000 million that goes to common stock holders\\n\\nAssuming a standard 10,000,000 shares issued at the formation of the startup and 80% dilution, and considering that you were given 23,000 shares from the ESOP, your full potential equity value would be (23,000 / 10,000,000) \\\\* $20,000,000 = $46,000.\\n\\n$46,000, fully vested.\\n\\nThat's a typical outcome for an employee of a startup. This number only goes down if the startup has issued additional shares. It can go up if the acquiring company is paying $200 or $300 million, but that's only 2x or 3x your equity.\\n\\nHopefully you've noticed how that company was built so that you can get a much bigger piece of the pie by either becoming a founder yourself or being a founding engineer or exec. You could also consult for a high ticket price.\\n\\nFor reference, in that hypothetical scenario with the founder split I mentioned, the COO would make $2 million, the CTO would make $4 million, and the CEO would make $8 million. That's enough money to potentially retire on fixed-income from real estate if they qualify for QSBS, meaning they wouldn't pay any taxes on the money they earn from the sale of the startup if they've held their options for more than 5 years and the assets of the startup did not exceed $50 million when they were granted their stock options. This sounds really unfair, but consider that many startups (and therefore jobs and career opportunities) might not exist if this incentive did not exist.\",\"parent_id\":\"t3_1h355mu\",\"ups\":45,\"_id\":\"675d9ab15eb32f14e7e01451\",\"id\":\"675d9ab15eb32f14e7e01451\"}\n",

From what you’ve shared, it seems like consulting could be a great side hustle for you, especially given your expertise and passion for mentoring and problem-solving.\\n\\nFirst, it’s smart to start small while keeping your day job, especially since you're supporting your family and still managing your startup. A side hustle in consulting allows you to gradually build a client base and test the waters without taking on too much risk. Plus, since you’re already working in consulting and mentoring, you likely have a network that can refer you to potential clients, or at least point you in the right direction.\\n\\nHere’s some advice for getting started:\\n\\n1. **Leverage Your Network**: Since you've been mentoring and working with others, start by offering your services to people within your network. You might already have people who trust you and could be interested in working with you.\\n2. **Define Your Niche**: Since you’re passionate about “tech for good,” that could be your unique selling proposition. Focus on solving problems for startups, nonprofits, or other organizations working in the tech-for-good space. Having a clear focus will help attract the right clients.\\n3. **Start with Small Projects**: Offering affordable, smaller-scale consulting services to begin with allows you to build your portfolio, refine your approach, and gain testimonials that will be valuable when you decide to scale up.\\n4. **Build an Online Presence**: Start a website, blog, or LinkedIn profile that highlights your experience, past projects, and areas of expertise. This will make it easier for potential clients to find you.\\n5. **Set Boundaries**: It’s important to balance your side hustle with your current job, so set clear boundaries about how much time you can dedicate to consulting without burning out. Be transparent with clients about your availability.\\n\\nLastly, you might also want to consider connecting with entrepreneurial communities and attending events or networking meetups to meet potential clients. Offering free or discounted advice or workshops to organizations or groups aligned with your passions could be a great way to get started.\\n\\nGood luck, and it’s inspiring to see your dedication to both your family and your entrepreneurial spirit!

This is my first time as a founder so I’m by no means an expert. \\n\\nFirst off, a lot of this can be up to you. This will be your company so you can make decisions that you feel are in the best interest of the company. If you’re not full time in the project you may have a harder time raising money. \\n\\nWe raised our round with a SAFE. There are several sites that can handle the paperwork on a SAFE easily and it made the round very smooth. Investors sign the paperwork and wire the money as soon as they are able. We fundraiser for about 3 months and ended up about 10% over subscribed. \\n\\nFor your salary I think that’s a big decision for a founder and is something you’ll have to decide based on your own situation. You have to be able to live so if you don’t take enough of a salary to live then you’ll be spending your time figuring out how to survive and not building the company. My partner and I pay ourselves well. Other founders take all of the money and put it into the business. Obviously how you compensate yourself affects runway. \\n\\nIn terms of how much to target for a runway that probably depends on your business as well. We’re building something that will take some time to produce in the physical world so we raised a few years worth. If you’re building something small and can have it done in a few months then you’ll won’t need to dilute yourself as much. Our target dilution for pre-seed was 20%.

I've not been successful in any of my endeavours (then again, my measure of success could differ from others) and there have been a lot of moments lately where I'm questioning myself. I recently came into some money through an inheritance and I'm going all in on the project I'm currently working on where it's my make or break. Issues I've encountered or I'm encountering:  \\n  \\n\\\\- The biggest one: I'm not a technical guy. My background is marketing, operations and management. Finding a technical co-founder has been the most daunting task.  \\n\\\\- I live in a country where tech, startups and generally the entrepreneurship community is not the best. (Canada. In case any of you are wondering).  \\n\\\\- I have guilt...a lot of it. My wife is the breadwinner now and she absolutely believes in me and what my project is, to which she's working extra hard to make ends meet so that I can focus on the startup. Seeing her work into early mornings and how tired she is on weekends breaks my heart.  \\n\\\\- Imposter syndrome: I see some of what you guys are doing and it's really impressive. Then I get inspired, go try and build a landing page and it's ass. I then ask myself: if I can't even build a landing page, how the fuck am I going to build my platform? (It's somewhat of a freelancer marketplace but with AI features. Think Uber Eats but for small tasks). Then there's self-doubt with skills, capability, financial literacy and many more which I'm not even going to bother as it's a totally different story.  \\n\\\\- Focus. This is a huge one. Coming from a career running marketing and digital experiences for some of the biggest brands and agencies in the world (not to brag but chances are, you have something in your house or used to have that I did their marketing for), I was operating at 1000 miles per hour. Now I'm on my own, there are moments where I'm struggling to maintain the momentum and find myself gaming for an hour which results in anxiety. I think to myself \\\"That hour gaming could have been spent on research or something that contributes to the success of my startup\\\". It's a very tough feeling to navigate through as it often ends up in me getting anxiety.\\n\\nSo to anyone out there thinking of running a startup or even wanting to embark on entrepreneurship, hopefully my post here can give some insight. The image of running a successful business, being the next Ivan Zhao or Dylan Field, is something that only happens very rarely. There's a lot of luck involved, mixed in with grit, determination and discipline. And it's ok if one doesn't succeed.

I spent a solid 4 months on this project, slowly chipping away at it while juggling studies and part-time work to make my idea a reality.\\n\\nAs a law student from India, I was balancing college classes while trying to make this dream come to life. Coding this website was an uphill task—there were many times when I didn’t know if I’d even get it to a functional state. I also invested a chunk of my savings to buy a .com domain, so now my website proudly lives on www.mattcases.com. After months of searching, I finally found a supplier for high-quality phone cases to sell, so it felt like things were finally falling into place.\\n\\nFor marketing, I decided to go with Facebook ads and put all my savings (around 2,000 rupees or $22.50) towards ads in hopes of getting some traction. Unfortunately, that credit ran out last week, and I haven’t managed to make a single sale yet. It’s frustrating because I’m just starting to learn how Facebook ads work, and it seems like getting decent conversions requires a lot more ad spend than I initially thought.\\n\\nI know my journey has just started, and I’m determined to keep going, but I’m a bit stuck right now with no budget left for ads and no sales to show for it yet. Building this website has taught me so much, and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, even if the results aren’t there just yet.\\n\\nIf you’re interested, please check out www.mattcases.com, and any support would mean the world to me!

I can tell that you're in a serious situation, and it seems to me like you have what it takes to eventually succeed as an entrepreneur, so I'll give you advice that I think will actually help you instead of trying to spare your feelings.\\n\\nFirst of all, I need more information to give you any decent advice here. Entrepreneurship is a lot more complex and difficult than people talking online make it seem like, and I don't know where you are on your skill set as an entrepreneur. I make a lot of assumptions in this comment because of the lack of information, but even if I gloss over some critical information that only you are privy to, I hope it's helpful anyway.\\n\\n**A few things that I can gather from this post that will work against you:**\\n\\n1. You need motivation. (Motivation is critical for success, and you need to already have it in a consistent way. It should either come from your internal perception of your reality, or the way your environment interacts with your state of psychological reward &amp; punishment. For this reason alone, I currently believe that if you try to start a business as you are now, you will fail.\\n2. You think that a landing page will get you customers. In other words, you currently know nothing about marketing, and are currently in the uniformed optimism phase of your knowledge about both marketing and entrepreneurship. ([Context for my usage of the phrase \\\"Uninformed optimism\\\"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uninformed-optimism-joe-cantanucci/)). If I assume that you will figure out a way to engineer your environment to lead you to consistent motivation, and I assume that your idea is targeting real customer pain and alleviating it, than you still need to set aside at minimum the next few months to learning marketing fundamentals.\\n3. You only have until march to succeed.\\n\\nIt sounds like you are set on starting a business. If you had years to keep trying, failing, and learning, I believe you would eventually succeed. But having less than 4 months to legitimately go through this process is literal insanity. You would be an outlier in the world of entrepreneurship if you were able to succeed that quickly.\\n\\n**A few things I can gather that will work for you:**\\n\\n1. You have a deadline. This could potentially become an internal motivator for you to succeed.\\n2. Since you already have a specific niche in mind, you might already be on the right track. The hardest part when you're getting started is finding a real problem to solve/making sure the customers you're helping are actually in pain. Without that, they probably won't pay you.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nI don't know much about how visas and deportation work, so I can't comment much on that. Just be careful since if you don't make money with your business before march, and you start applying to jobs too late, you could find yourself in the worst possible situation.\\n\\nUltimately, I think you should apply to every job you can right now and focus all of your attention on securing your visa right now. Once you have one, you can start saving cash for your future venture, while figuring out ways to secure your visa longer.\\n\\nI understand the desire to do what you're uniquely qualified to do better than probably anyone you've talked to before, because it's been a major theme in my life. So I understand how hard it probably is for you to accept my previous statement. But I say it anyway because **you absolutely must avoid making gambles where the outcome is unacceptable if you lose**. If you take enough of those gambles in your lifetime, you will eventually lose everything. No matter how competent or successful you are or become.\\n\\nWhen you make a post like this in the future, I recommend including more details. I can only respond to the information you've given me in this post, so any information you've left out is context I can not respond to.\\n\\n**Example information you should include:**\\n\\n\\\\- What is currently motivating you  \\n\\\\- Your expertise  \\n\\\\- Industry experience  \\n\\\\- Your economic situation  \\n\\\\- Your age  \\n\\\\- Your ICP  \\n\\\\- Your approach on reaching PMF  \\n\\\\- What you've tried that's failed in the past and why you believe it's failed  \\n\\\\- What you've tried that's succeeded in the past and why you believe it succeeded.  \\n\\\\- Why you think your current project may fail or succeed.\\n\\nI really wish you the best.

This one is arguable. It's possible to succeed without domain expertise. Sometimes it's even helpful not to have it: fresh eyes and all that.

You will already have a deep understanding of problems that need to be solved in the sector, (possibly) how to solve them and (possibly) a network and/or credible standing with your customers.\\n\\nSkillset. I, as a software engineer, can build some cool software solution. But, can I market it? Can I sell it? Can I raise funds from investors? Lot's of people think that stuff is easy, but it's not. And they fail. There is a LONG history of \\\"better\\\" products losing to \\\"inferior\\\" products due to marketing and sales execution.\\n\\nAbility to learn and adapt. Everyone is different.

It's a real skill to know when to quit, when to pivot and when to keep going.\\n\\nPersonal circumstance. Are you independently wealthy? Can you afford to fail and try again? Can you afford to work on your idea full-time? Do you have a network of people in the same boat as you? Then there's a good chance that you'll have some success, sooner or later. If you can't afford to even take one decent swing at the pitch, then the chances you succeed are very low. You're trying to work on your idea around full-time work. You can't quit your job, which basically rules-out getting VC funding. The only co-founder you can find will be in the same boat as you. Your options are very limited.\\n\\nTiming.

In product development, it’s often used early in the project lifecycle to test a specific feature, technology, or component to ensure it works as expected. The focus of a POC is not to create a fully functional product but to verify if something can be done. For example, a POC might involve developing a mockup or a basic version of a single key feature to demonstrate that it can technically work within the project’s constraints.\\n\\nPurpose:To validate the technical feasibility of a concept or feature.\\n\\nScope:Usually very limited, focusing only on the technical aspects of a single idea or technology.\\n\\nAudience: Often for internal stakeholders or technical teams who need to know if a certain approach will work.\\n\\nMVP (Minimum Viable Product):\\n\\nA Minimum Viable Product, on the other hand, is a functional version of a product that has enough core features to be usable by early adopters. The goal of an MVP is to launch quickly with just enough functionality to test the product’s value in the market, gather user feedback, and start iterating based on real user interaction. Unlike a POC, an MVP is not just about proving feasibility—it’s meant to provide actual value to users, albeit in a limited form.\\n\\nPurpose: To test market demand and gather feedback from real users.\\n\\nScope: A fully functional product, but with only essential features.\\n\\nAudience: Released to real users to validate the product’s value in the market.\\n\\nThe main difference is \\\\*purpose\\\\*: a POC is for testing technical feasibility, while an MVP is for testing market viability with a functional, user-ready product.\\n\\n  \\nEDIT: After you have POC, You NEED to fill in Business Moden Canvas.
